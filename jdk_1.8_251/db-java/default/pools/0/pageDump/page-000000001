An instance of an FSM may be created either by callingStateEngine.makeFSM( startState ) on a state engine, or by extending FSMImpl andusing a constructor.  Using FSMImpl as a base class is convenient ifadditional state is associated with the FSM beyond that encodedby the current state.  This is especially convenient if an actionneeds some additional information.  For example, counters are besthandled by special actions rather than encoding a bounded counterin a state machine.

The FSM only needs the identity of thisdescription or name of the state.  The StateImpl class handles this.Pre- and post- actions are taken only on completed transitions betweendifferent states.  Assume that the FSM is in state A, and the FSM willtransition to state B under input I with action X.  If A != B and X completessuccessfully, then after X completes execution, A.postAction is executed,followed by B.preAction.Method that defines action that occurs whenever this state is entered.Any exceptions thrown by this method are ignored.Method that defines action that occurs whenever this state is exited. end of State.java/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/corba/se/spi/orbutil/fsm/StateEngine.javaA StateEngine defines the state transition function for afinite state machine (FSM). A FSM always has a current state.In response to an Input, the FSM performs an Action andmakes a transition to a new state.  Note that any object canbe used as an input if it supports the Input interface.For example, a protocol message may be an input.  The FSMuses only the result of calling getLabel on the Input todrive the transition.The function can be non-deterministicin that the same input may cause transitions to different newstates from the current state.  In this case, the action thatis executed for the transition must set the correct new state.Add a new transition (old,in,guard,act,new) to the state engine.Multiple calls to add with the same old and in are permitted,in which case only a transition in which the guard evaluates totrue will be taken.  If no such transition is enabled, a defaultwill be taken.  If more than one transition is enabled, one willbe chosen arbitrarily.This method can only be called before done().  An attempt tocall it after done() results in an IllegalStateException.Add a transition with a guard that always evaluates to true.Set the default transition and action for a state.This transition will be used if no more specific transition wasdefined for the actual input.  Repeated calls to this methodsimply change the default.Equivalent to setDefault( oldState, act, newState ) where act is anaction that does nothing.Euaivalent to setDefault( oldState, oldState )Set the default action used in this state engine.  This is theaction that is called whenever there is no applicable transition.Normally this would simply flag an error.  This method can onlybe called before done().  An attempt toCalled after all transitions have been added to the state engine.This provides an opportunity for the implementation to optimizeits representation before the state engine is used.  This methodmay only be called once.  An attempt to call it more than onceresults in an IllegalStateException.Create an instance of a FSM that uses this state engine.The initial state of the FSM will be the stateState specifiedhere.

In any other case we must use writePixels() BugId 4892214: we can not work with raster directly if image have different color order than RGB. We should use writePixels() for such images. we will use getPixels() to extract pixel data for writePixels() Please note that getPixels() provides rgb bands order.XXX: check more Number of bytes that a scanline for the image written out will have. ImageWriteParam.MODE_DISABLED: we should use 32bpp images in case of BI_BITFIELD compression to avoid color conversion artefacts Setting this flag to false ensures that generic writePixels() will be used to store image dataNB: canEncodeImage() ensures we have image ofeither USHORT_565_RGB or USHORT_555_RGB type here.Technically, it should work for other direct colormodel types but it might be non compatible with win98and friends. it is unlikely, but if it happens, we should throw an exception related to unsupported image format prepare info for writePixels procedure handle BI_RGB compression Cannot be written as a Palette image. So write out as 24 bit image.

Writing of actual image data Buffer for up to 8 rows of pixels Also create a buffer to hold one line of the data to be written to the file, so we can use array writes. prepare embedded buffer update the file/image Size Get the pixelsbyte[] bdata =    ((DataBufferByte)src.getDataBuffer()).getData();System.out.println("bdata.length="+bdata.length);System.arraycopy(bdata, pos, bpixels, 0, scanlineBytes); pixel data is provided here in RGB order Write the RLE EOF marker and Partially filled last byte, if any Put the last pixel of odd-length lines in the 4 MSBsWe expect that pixel data comes in RGB order.We will assemble short pixel taking into accountthe compression type:BI_RGB        - the RGB order should be maintained.BI_BITFIELDS  - use bitPos array that was builtaccording to bitfields masks.please note that despite other cases,the 16bpp BI_RGB requires the RGB data order Since BMP needs BGR format Case where IndexColorModel had > 256 colors.We will assemble int pixel taking into accountthe compression type.BI_RGB        - the BGR order should be used. We have two possibilities here: 1. we are writing the indexed image with bitfields    compression (this covers also the case of BYTE_BINARY)    => use icm to get actual RGB color values. 2. we are writing the gray-scaled image with BI_BITFIELDS    compression    => just replicate the level of gray to color components.

BI_RGB case, according to the MSDN description:The bitmap has a maximum of 2^16 colors. If thebiCompression member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER is BI_RGB,the bmiColors member of BITMAPINFO is NULL. Each WORDin the bitmap array represents a single pixel. Therelative intensities of red, green, and blue arerepresented with five bits for each color component.2.

Ideally these methods would be in the ImageReader base classso that all subclasses could benefit from them, but that would be anaddition to the existing API, and it is not yet clear whether these methodsare universally useful, so for now we will leave them here. Helper for computeUpdatedPixels method We need to satisfy the congruences: dst = destinationOffset + (src - sourceOffset)/sourceSubsampling src - passStart == 0 (mod passPeriod) src - sourceOffset == 0 (mod sourceSubsampling) subject to the inequalities: src >= passStart src < passStart + passExtent src >= sourceOffset src < sourceOffset + sourceExtent dst >= dstMin dst <= dstmax where For now we use a brute-force approach although we could attempt to analyze the congruences.  If passPeriod and sourceSubsamling are relatively prime, the period will be their product.  If they share a common factor, either the period will be equal to the larger value, or the sequences will be completely disjoint, depending on the relationship between passStart and sourceOffset.  Since we only have to do this twice per image (once each for X and Y), it seems cheap enough to do it the straightforward way. Record smallest valid pixel Record second smallest valid pixel Record largest valid pixel If we never saw a valid pixel, set width to 0 The period is given by the difference of any two adjacent pixelsA utility method that computes the exact set of destinationpixels that will be written during a particular decoding pass.The intent is to simplify the work done by readers in combiningthe source region, source subsampling, and destination offsetinformation obtained from the <code>ImageReadParam</code> withthe offsets and periods of a progressive or interlaced decodingpass.a <code>Rectangle</code> containing thesource region being read, offset by the source subsamplingoffsets, and clipped against the source bounds, as returned bythe <code>getSourceRegion</code> method.a

Check for ability to encode image. Determine source region and destination dimensions. Convert any provided image metadata. Converted rgb image can use palette different from global. In order to avoid color artefacts we want to be sure we use appropriate palette. For this we initialize local color table from current color and sample models. At this point we can guarantee that local color table can be build because image was already converted to indexed or gray-scale representations in case of indexed image we should take care of transparent pixelsNB: transparentColorFlag might have not beed reset forgreyscale images but explicitly reseting it hereis potentially not right thing to do until we have wayto find whether current value was explicitly set bythe user.

Create a color table. Set the Global Color Table. At this point it should be A) the global color table provided in stream metadata, if any; B) the local color table of the image metadata, if any, if    writing a sequence; C) a table created on the basis of the first image ColorModel    and SampleModel if no local color table is available; or D) null if none of the foregoing conditions obtain (which    should only be if a sequence is not being written and    a local color table is provided in image metadata).

Any of these secondary typesthat occur are kept as members of a single JFIFMarkerSegment object. If present optional ICCSet to <code>true</code> when reading the chunks of anICC profile.  All chunks are consolidated to create a single"segment" containing all the chunks.  This flag is a statevariable identifying whether to construct a new segment orappend to an old one.A placeholder for an ICC profile marker segment underconstruction.  The segment is not added to the listuntil all chunks have been read.Default constructor.

If there are more thumbnails than metadata segments,default encoding is used for the extra thumbnails. All others write as separate JFXX segments Just the header without any thumbnail No thumbnails We never write a palette image into the header So if it's the only one, we need to write the header first Expand to RGB Handles clipping if needed As part of the header If this is the only one, write the header first Could put reason codes in here to be parsed in writeJFXXSegment in order to provide more meaningful warnings.Writes out a new JFXX extension segment, without saving it.Return an RGB image that is the expansion of the given grayscaleimage.Writes out a default JFIF marker segment to the givenoutput stream.

This method will have to deal with all the parametersand formats (%u with possibly large numbers, %02d, %02x, etc.)that actually occur in the JPEG library.  For now, this preventslibrary warnings from being printed to stderr.This method is called from native code in order to fillnative input buffer.We block any attempt to change the reading state during thismethod, in order to prevent a corruption of the native decoderstate.number of bytes read from the stream.This method is called from the native code in order toskip requested number of bytes in the input stream. Read the first header This reads the tables-only image twice, once from C and once from Java, but only if ignoreMetadata is false Now we are at the first image if there are any, so add it to the list Not tables only, so add original pos to the list And set current image since we've read it now If the image positions list is empty as in the case of a tables-only stream, then attempting to access the element at index imagePositions.size() - 1 will cause an IndexOutOfBoundsException. locked thread Otherwise we have to read the entire stream FALL THROUGH to decrement buffer vars This first set doesn't have a length not a marker, just a data 0xff All the others have a length length includes itself Search is necessary for JPEGSets the input stream to the start of the requested image.if the input source has not beenset.IndexOutOfBoundsExceptionif the supplied index isout of bounds. stream, then no image data can be read. read to start of image, saving positions First seek to the last position we already have, and skip the entire image Now add all intervening positions, skipping images Is there an image? Otherwise we are where we want to be No way is native buffer still validSkip over a complete image in the stream, leaving the streampositioned such that the next byte to be read is the firstbyte of the next image.  For JPEG, this means that we readuntil we encounter an EOI marker or until the end of the stream.If the stream ends before an EOI marker is encountered, anIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown.Returns <code>true</code> if there is an image beyondthe current stream position.  Does not disturb thestream position. We hit the end of the stream before we hit an SOI, so no imagePush back the given number of bytes to the input stream.Called by the native code at the end of each image sothat the next one can be identified from Java. The buffer is clear after this, so no need to set haveSeeked.Reads header information for the given image, if possible. Ignore returnRead in the header information starting from the currentstream position, returning <code>true</code> if theheader was a tables-only image.  After this call, thenative IJG decompression struct will contain the imageinformation required by most query calls below(e.g. getWidth, getHeight, etc.), if the header was nota tables-only image.If reset is <code>true</code>, the state of the IJGobject is reset so that it can read a header again.This happens automatically if the header was a tables-onlyCalled by the native code whenever an image header has beenread.  Whether we read metadata or not, we always need thisinformation, so it is passed back independently ofmetadata, which may never be read.Color profile data seems to be invalid.Ignore this profile.At the moment we can't rely on the ColorSpace.equals()and ICC_Profile.equals() because they do not detectthe case when two profiles are created from same data.So, we have to do data comparison in order to avoidcreation of different ColorSpace instances for the sameembedded data. verify new color spaceEmbedded profile seems to be corrupted.///////// Color Conversion and Image TypesReturn an ImageTypeSpecifier corresponding to the givencolor space code, or null if the color space is unsupported. Returns null if it can't be represented We return an iterator containing the default, any conversions that the library provides, and all the other default types with the same number of components, as we can do these as a post-process. As we convert Rasters rather than images, images with alpha cannot be converted in a post-process. If this image can't be interpreted, this method returns an empty Iterator. Get the raw ITS, if there is one.  Note that this won't always be the same as the default. Given the encoded colorspace, build a list of ITS's representing outputs you could handle starting with the default. Might be null if PYCC.pf not installed As there is no YCbCr ColorSpace, we can't support the raw type. due to 4705399, use RGB as default in order to avoid slowing down of drawing operations with result image. Assume it's for RGB Default is to convert to RGBAChecks the implied color conversion between the stream andthe target image, altering the IJG output color space if necessary.If a java color conversion is required, then this sets up<code>convert</code>.If bands are being rearranged at all (either source or destinationbands are specified in the param), then the default colorconversions are assumed to be correct.Throws an IIOException if there is no conversion available. If we are rearranging channels at all, the default conversions remain in place.  If the user wants raw channels then he should do this while reading a Raster. Accept default conversions out of decoder, silently XXX - We do not currently support any indexed color models, though we could, as IJG will quantize for us. This is a performance and memory-use issue, as users can read RGB and then convert to indexed in Java. Now check the ColorSpace type against outColorSpaceCode We may want to tweak the default Its gray in the file We want RGB IJG can do this for us more efficiently Update java state according to changes in the native part of decoder. IJG wants to go to RGB We want gray If the jpeg space is YCbCr, IJG can do it We have an ICC profile but it isn't used in the dest image.  So convert from the profile cs to the target cs Leave IJG conversion in place; we still need it Target isn't sRGB, so convert from sRGB to the target No conversions available; image must be RGBA We can't do YCC at all No conversions available; image must be YCCA Anything else we can't handle at allSet the IJG output space to the given value.  The library willperform the appropriate colorspace conversions.///// End of Color Conversion & Image Types imageMetadataIndex will always be either a valid index or -1, in which case imageMetadata will not be null. So we can leave checking imageIndex for gotoImage. don't keep a reference here Can we read this image? The destination may still be incompatible. Check whether we can handle any implied color conversion Throws IIOException if the stream and the image are incompatible, and sets convert if a java conversion is necessary Check the source and destination bands in the param Set the output color space equal to the input colorspace This disables all conversions Create an intermediate 1-line Raster that will hold the decoded, subsampled, clipped, band-selected image data in a single byte-interleaved buffer.  The above transformations will occur in C for performance.  Every time this Raster is filled we will call back to acceptPixels below to copy this to whatever kind of buffer our image has. ignore dest bands for Raster Now that we have the Raster we'll decode to, get a view of the target Raster that will permit a simple setRect for each scanlineIf the process is sequential, and we have restart markers,we could skip to the correct restart marker, if the librarylets us.  That's an optimization to investigate later. Check for update listeners (don't call back if none) Set up progression data if we have a metadata object, we can count the scans and set knownPassCount We have metadata Finally, we are ready to read Note that getData disables acceleration on buffer, but it is just a 1-line intermediate data transfer buffer that will not affect the acceleration of the resulting image.This method is called back from C when the intermediate Rasteris full.  The parameter indicates the scanline in the targetRaster to which the intermediate Raster should be copied.After the copy, we notify update listeners. Use the range of allowed progressive passes Assume there are a minimum of MIN_ESTIMATED_PASSES and that there is always one more pass Compute the percentage as the percentage at the end of the previous pass, plus the percentage of this pass scaled to be the percentage of the total remaining, assuming a minimum of MIN_ESTIMATED_PASSES passes and that there is always one more pass.  This is monotonic and asymptotic to 1.0, which is what we need. including this one Provide access to protected superclass methodReturns <code>true</code> if the read was aborted.NB: we do not check the call back lock here,we allow to abort the reader any time.Set the C level abort flag. Keep it atomic for thread safety.Resets library state when an exception occurred during a read.This could be further optimized by not resetting the dest.offset and creating a translated raster in readInternal()(see bug 4994702 for more info). For Rasters, destination offset is logical, not physical, so set it to 0 before calling computeRegions, so that the destination region is not clipped. Apply the destination offset, if any, as a logical offset checks iis state for us Now check the jfif segments Now we know that there is a jfif segment Now we know that there is a jfif segment and that iis is good reset C structures reset local Java structures it looks like that this reader instance is used by multiple threads.An internal helper class that wraps producer's iteratorand extracts specifier instances on demand.An internal helper class that provides means for deferred creationof ImageTypeSpecifier instance required to describe availabledestination types.This implementation only supports standardjpeg color spaces (defined by corresponding JCS color space code).To support other color spaces one can override produce() method toreturn custom instance of ImageTypeSpecifier. undefined/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/imageio/plugins/jpeg/JPEGImageReaderResources.java"Truncated File - Missing EOI marker"Truncated File - Missing EOI marker"JFIF markers not allowed in JFIF JPEG thumbnail; ignored"JFIF markers not allowed in JFIF JPEG thumbnail; ignored"Embedded color profile is invalid; ignored"Embedded color profile is invalid; ignored/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/imageio/plugins/jpeg/JPEGImageReaderSpi.java/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/target/classes/com/sun/imageio/plugins/jpeg/JPEGImageReaderSpi.class"com.sun.imageio.plugins.jpeg.JPEGImageWriterSpi"com.sun.imageio.plugins.jpeg.JPEGImageWriterSpi"com.sun.imageio.plugins.jpeg.JPEGImageReader"com.sun.imageio.plugins.jpeg.JPEGImageReader"Standard JPEG Image Reader"Standard JPEG Image Readerbyte1byte2 If the first two bytes are a JPEG SOI marker, it's probably a JPEG file.

This isprobably best avoided, so the following convert only text nodes tocomments, and lose the keywords as well. ColorSpaceType can change the target colorspace for compression This must take any transparency node into account as well, as that affects the number of channels (if alpha is present).  If a transparency node is dealt with here, set a flag to indicate this to the transparency processor below.  If we discover that the nodes are not in order, throw an exception as the tree is invalid. If there is no ColorSpaceType node, we have nothing to do We can't handle them, so don't modify any metadata out of for If the metadata specifies progressive, then the number of channels must match, so that we can modify all the existing SOS marker segments. If they don't match, we don't know what to do with SOS so we can't do the merge.  We then just return silently. An exception would not be appropriate.  A warning might, but we have nowhere to send it to. Progressive JFIF header might be removed Now add a JFIF if we do want one, but only if it isn't stream metadata Adobe header might be removed or the transform modified, if it isn't stream metadata Keep the old componentSpecs array SOF might be modified Now replace the SOF with a new one; it might be the same, but this is easier. we never need extended Now suss out if subsampling changed and set the boolean for updating the q tables if the old componentSpec q table selectors don't match the new ones, update the qtables.  The new selectors are already in place in the new SOF segment above. if the component ids are different, update all the existing scans ignore Huffman tables update the ids in each SOS marker segment Find the position in the old componentSpecs array of the old component with the old selector and replace the component selector with the new id at the same position, as these match the new component specs array in the SOF created above. htables - if the old htable selectors don't match the new ones, update the tables. Might be the same as the old one, but this is easier. should be stream metadata if there isn't an SOF, but check it anyway update tables - routines below check if it's really necessary If there are no tables, don't add them, as the metadata encodes an abbreviated stream. If we are not subsampling, we just need one, so don't do anything Is it really necessary?  There should be at least 2 tables. If there is only one, assume it's a scaled "standard" luminance table, extract the scaling factor, and generate a scaled "standard" chrominance table. Find the table with selector 1.    find the table with selector 0.  There should be one. Assuming that the table with id 0 is a luminance table, compute a new chrominance table of the same quality and add it to the last DQT segment Is it really necessary?  There should be at least 2 dc and 2 ac tables.  If there is only one, add a "standard " chrominance table. find a table with selector 1. AC/DC is irrelevant Create new standard dc and ac chrominance tables and add them to the last DHT segment Alpha must be first if present NumProgressiveScans is ignored.  Progression must be enabled on the ImageWriteParam. Pixel Aspect Ratio or pixel size can be incorporated if there is, or can be, a JFIF segment Can there be one? Criteria: SOF must be present with 1 or 3 channels, (stream metadata fails this)     Component ids must be JFIF compatible. remaining tests are negative if Adobe present, transform = ADOBE_UNKNOWN for 1-channel,     ADOBE_YCC for 3-channel. If so, create one and insert it into the sequence.  Note that default is just pixel ratio at 1:1 Convert from mm/dot to dots/cmReturn a pair of integers whose ratio (x/y) approximates the givenfloat value. Normalize Deal with min case Deal with max case Remember if we invert First approximation not close enough Increment y and compute a new x Convert to comments.  For the moment ignore the encoding issue. Ignore keywords, language, and encoding (for the moment). If compression tag is present, use only entries with "none". This might indicate that an alpha channel is being added or removed. The nodes must appear in order, and a Chroma node will process any transparency, so process it here only if there was no Chroma node Do nothing for stream metadata do we have alpha already?  If the number of channels is 2 or 4, we do, as we don't support CMYK, nor can we add alpha to it The number of channels can be determined from the SOF We can do nothing for progressive, as we don't know how to modify the scans. Do we already have alpha?  We can tell by the number of channels We must have an sof, or we can't do anything further proceed only if the old state and the new state differ Adding alpha If an adobe marker is present, transform must be UNKNOWN Add a component spec with appropriate parameters to SOF Add a component spec with appropriate parameters to SOS Removing alpha Remove a component spec from SOF Remove a component spec from SOS In this case a reset followed by a merge is correct Build a whole new marker sequence from the tree for all the children, add a marker segmentCheck that this metadata object is in a consistent state andreturn <code>true</code> if it is or <code>false</code>otherwise.  All the constructors and modifiers should callthis method at the end to guarantee that the data is alwaysconsistent, as the writer relies on this.

Eachone is derived from the ASCII values of its 4-character name.  Forexample, IHDR_TYPE is calculated as follows:('I' << 24) | ('H' << 16) | ('D' << 8) | 'R' Critical chunks Ancillary chunks The number of bands by PNG color type gray unused rgb gray + alpha rgb + alpha The number of source pixels processed The total number of pixels in the source image Re-use signature array to bulk-read these unsigned byte values Skip IHDR CRC Round array sizes up to 2^2^n RGB or RGB_ALPHAAccording to PNG specification length ofhIST chunk is specified in bytes andhIST chunk consists of 2 byte elements(so we expect length is even). Decompress the text Alpha table may have fewer entries than RGB paletteOptimization: We can skip the remaining metadata if theignoreMetadata flag is set, and only if this is not a paletteimage (in that case, we need to read the metadata to get thetRNS chunk, which is needed for the getImageTypes() method). We've reached the image data Skip the chunk plus the 4 CRC bytes that follow verify the chunk length If chunk type is 'IDAT', we've reached the image data. Read an unknown chunk double check whether all chunk data were consumed Data filtering methods G GA in GA order RGB in RGB order RGBA in RGBA order Read the image row-by-row Skip filter byte and the remaining row bytes If read has been aborted, just return processReadAborted will be called later Determine which pixels will be updated in this pass If no pixels need updating, just skip the input data Update count of pixels read Backwards map from destination pixels (dstX = updateMinX + k*updateXStep) to source pixels (sourceX), and then to offset and skip in passRow (srcX and srcXStep) Compute the step factor in the source Create a 1-row tall Raster to hold the data Create an array suitable for holding one pixel Handle source and destination bands Determine if all of the relevant output bands have the same bit depth as the source data If the bit depths differ, create a lookup table per band to perform the conversion Limit passRow to relevant area for the case where we will can setRect to copy a contiguous span Decode the (sub)image row-by-row Read the filter type byte and a row of data Swap curr and prior TODO - throw a more meaningful exception Copy data into passRow byte by byte True Y position in source Init default values If an ImageReadParam is available, get values from itInflaterInputStream uses an Inflater instance which consumesnative (non-GC visible) resources. This is normally implicitlyfreed when the stream is closed. However since theInflaterInputStream wraps a client-supplied input stream,we cannot close it.But the app may depend on GC finalization to close the stream.Therefore to ensure timely freeing of native resources weexplicitly create the Inflater instance and free its resourceswhen we are done with the InflaterInputStream by callinginf.end();NB: the PNG spec declares that valid range for widthand height is [1, 2^31-1], so here we may fail to allocatea buffer for destination image due to memory limitation.However, the recovery strategy for this case should bedefined on the level of application, so we will nottry to estimate the required amount of the memory and/orhandle OOM in any way. At this point the header has been read and we know how many bands are in the image, so perform checking of the read param. Packed grayscale some standard types of buffered images which can be used as destination Component R, G, B Need tRNS chunkThe PLTE chunk spec says:The number of palette entries must not exceed the range thatcan be represented in the image bit depth (for example, 2^4 = 16for a bit depth of 4). It is permissible to have fewer entriesthan the bit depth would allow. In that case, any out-of-rangepixel value found in the image data is an error.http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Chunks.html#C.PLTEConsequently, the case when the palette length is smaller than2^bitDepth is legal in the view of PNG spec.However the spec of createIndexed() method demands the exactequality of the palette lengh and number of possible paletteentries (2^bitDepth).{@link javax.imageio.ImageTypeSpecifier.html#createIndexed}In order to avoid this contradiction we need to extend thepalette arrays to the limit defined by the bitDepth. Alpha from tRNS chunk may have fewer entries than the RGB LUTs from the PLTE chunk; if so, pad with 255. Component G, A wich can be used as destination Component R, G, B, A (non-premultiplied)Super class implementation uses first elementof image types list as raw image type.Also, super implementation uses first element of this listas default destination type image read param does not specifyanything other.However, in case of RGB and RGBA color types, raw image typeproduces buffered image of custom type. It causes someperformance degradation of subsequent rendering operations.To resolve this contradiction we put standard image typesat the first positions of image types list (to produce standardimages by default) and put raw image type (which is custom)at the last position of this list.After this changes we should override getRawImageType()to return last element of image types list./Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/imageio/plugins/png/PNGImageReaderSpi.java/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/target/classes/com/sun/imageio/plugins/png/PNGImageReaderSpi.class"image/png"image/png"image/x-png"image/x-png"com.sun.imageio.plugins.png.PNGImageReader"com.sun.imageio.plugins.png.PNGImageReader"com.sun.imageio.plugins.png.PNGImageWriterSpi"com.sun.imageio.plugins.png.PNGImageWriterSpi"com.sun.imageio.plugins.png.PNGMetadataFormat"com.sun.imageio.plugins.png.PNGMetadataFormat"Standard PNG image reader"Standard PNG image reader/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/imageio/plugins/png/PNGImageWriter.java/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_251.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/rt.jar/com/sun/imageio/plugins/png/CRC.classcrcTable0xedb88320-306674912/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_251.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/rt.jar/com/sun/imageio/plugins/png/ChunkStream.class"Method not available"Method not availablefinishChunkfinishChunk()/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_251.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/rt.jar/com/sun/imageio/plugins/png/IDATOutputStream.classstartChunkstartChunk()bytesRemainingdef'T'wbufinitializeScaleTablesinitializeScaleTables(int[])/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/target/classes/com/sun/imageio/plugins/png/PNGImageWriter.classequals(int[],int[])writeIENDwriteIEND()write_IDATwrite_IDAT(java.awt.image.RenderedImage)encodePassencodePass(javax.imageio.stream.ImageOutputStream,java.awt.image.RenderedImage,int,int,int,int)chunkType(java.lang.String)writeUnknownChunkswriteUnknownChunks()write_zTXtwrite_zTXt()write_iTXtwrite_iTXt()deflatedeflate(byte[])write_tEXtwrite_tEXt()write_tIMEwrite_tIME()write_sPLTwrite_sPLT()write_pHYswrite_pHYs()write_bKGDwrite_bKGD()write_tRNSwrite_tRNS()write_hISTwrite_hIST()write_PLTEwrite_PLTE()write_sRGBwrite_sRGB()write_sBITwrite_sBIT()write_iCCPwrite_iCCP()write_gAMAwrite_gAMA()write_cHRMwrite_cHRM()write_IHDRwrite_IHDR()write_magicwrite_magic()allowedProgressivePassesscalelscalehscale0scalingBitDepthfilteredRowscurrRowprevRowrowFilter"output not an ImageOutputStream!"output not an ImageOutputStream!"Only compression method 0 is defined in PNG 1.1"Only compression method 0 is defined in PNG 1.1"Only filter method 0 is defined in PNG 1.1"Only filter method 0 is defined in PNG 1.1"Only interlace methods 0 (node) and 1 (adam7) are defined in PNG 1.1"Only interlace methods 0 (node) and 1 (adam7) are defined in PNG 1.1"sBIT metadata has wrong color type.\n" +

chunk 0 == none, 1 == adam7 PLTE chunk If non-null, used to reorder palette entries during encoding in order to minimize the size of the tRNS chunk.  Thus an index of 'i' in the source should be encoded as index 'PLTE_order[i]'. PLTE_order will be null unless 'initialize' is called with an IndexColorModel image type. bKGD chunk If external (non-PNG sourced) data has red = green = blue, always store it as gray and promote when writing PNG_COLOR_GRAY, _RGB, or _PALETTE cHRM chunk gAMA chunk hIST chunk iCCP chunk iTXt chunk pHYs chunk 0 == unknown, 1 == meter sBIT chunk PNG_COLOR_GRAY, _GRAY_ALPHA, _RGB, _RGB_ALPHA sPLT chunk 1-79 characters 8 or 16 sRGB chunk tEXt chunk tIME chunk tRNS chunk May have fewer entries than PLTE_red, etc. zTXt chunk Unknown chunks TODO -- implementSets the IHDR_bitDepth and IHDR_colorType variables.The <code>numBands</code> parameter is necessary sincewe may only be writing a subset of the image bands. Initialize IHDR_bitDepth Choose max bit depth over all channels Fixes bug 4413109 Multi-channel images must have a bit depth of 8 or 16 Round bit depth up to a power of 2 Initialize IHDR_colorType Determine whether the color tables are actually a gray ramp if the color type has not been set previously Determine whether transparency existsNB: PNG_COLOR_GRAY_ALPHA color type may be not optimal for imagescontained more than 1024 pixels (or even than 768 pixels in case ofsingle transparent pixel in palette).For such images alpha samples in raster will occupy more space thanit is required to store palette so it could be reasonable touse PNG_COLOR_PALETTE color type for large images. Reorder the palette so that non-opaque entries come first.  Since the tRNS chunk does not have to store trailing 255's, this can save a considerable amount of space when encoding images with only one transparent pixel value, e.g., images from GIF sources. Scan for non-opaque entries and assign them positions starting at 0. Scan for opaque entries and assign them positions following the non-opaque entries. Reorder the palettes All have the same length Copy only the transparent entries into tRNS_alpha Deep clone unknownChunkData needs deep clone IHDR IHDR_compressionMethod must be 0 in PNG 1.1 IHDR_filterMethod must be 0 in PNG 1.1 PLTE bKGD cHRM gAMA hIST iCCP iTXt pHYs sBIT sPLT sRGB tEXt tIME tRNS zTXt Determine number of channels Be careful about palette color with transparency sBIT_colorType == PNGImageReader.PNG_COLOR_RGB || sBIT_colorType == PNGImageReader.PNG_COLOR_RGB_ALPHA Guard against partial overwrite silently skip invalid text entryAccrding to PNG spec, keywords are restricted to 1 to 79 bytesin length.

Stream can be closedexplicitly without removal from StreamCloser queue.Explicit removal from the queue only helps to save some memory. Make a copy of the set in order to avoid concurrent modification (the is.close() will in turn call removeFromQueue())The thread must be a member of a thread groupwhich will not get GCed before VM exit.Make its parent the top-level thread group.Set context class loader to null in order to avoidkeeping a strong reference to an application classloader./Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/imageio/stream/StreamFinalizer.java/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/target/classes/com/sun/imageio/stream/StreamFinalizer.classSmall class to assist in properly closing an ImageInputStream instanceprior to garbage collection.  The ImageInputStreamImpl class defines afinalize() method, but in a number of its public subclasses(e.g. FileImageInputStream) we override the finalize() method to beempty for performance reasons, and instead rely on the Disposer mechanismfor closing/disposing resources.  This is fine when one of these classesis instantiated directly (e.g. new FileImageInputStream()) but in theunlikely case where a user defines their own subclass of one of thosestreams, we need some way to get back to the behavior ofImageInputStreamImpl, which will call close() as part of finalization.Typically an Image{Input,Output}Stream will construct an instance ofStreamFinalizer in its constructor if it detects that it has beensubclassed by the user.  The ImageInputStream instance will hold areference to the StreamFinalizer, and the StreamFinalizer will hold areference back to the ImageInputStream from which it was created.  Whenboth are no longer reachable, the StreamFinalizer.finalize() method willbe called, which will take care of closing down the ImageInputStream.Clearly this is a bit of a hack, but it will likely only be used in therarest of circumstances: when a user has subclassed one of the publicstream classes.  (It should be no worse than the old days when the publicstream classes had non-empty finalize() methods.)/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/java/swing/Painter.java/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/java/swing/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/javacom.sun.java.swingjavax.swingPainter<T>/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/target/classes/javax/swing/Painter.class/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/target/classes/javax/swing/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/target/classes/javaxCopyright (c) 2005, 2013, Oracle and/or its affiliates.

That's ok, we'll use f as is ComponentUI Interface Implementation methods Top row of buttons CurrentDir ComboBox CENTER: left, right, accessory SPLIT PANEL: left, right left panel - Filter & directoryList Add the Directory List Create a label that looks like button (should be a table header) create files list add the fileName field Add the filter combo box Add buttons PENDING - this is inefficient - should sent out incremental adjustment values instead of saying that the whole list has changed. PENDING - fire the correct interval changed - currently sending out that everything has changed PENDING - fire the interval changed DataModel for DirectoryComboxboxData model for a type-face selection combo-box. Add the current directory to the model, and make it the selectedDirectoryAdds the directory to the model and sets it to be selected,additionally clears out the previous selected directory andthe paths leading up to it, if any. Get the canonical (full) path. This has the side benefit of removing extraneous chars from the path, for example /foo/bar/ becomes /foo/bar Maybe drive is not ready. Can't abort here. create File instances of each directory leading up to the topActs when DirectoryComboBox has changed the selected item.Creates a new folder. Ok, use f as isRenames file Renderer for Filter ComboBoxRender different filters As SynthComboBoxRenderer's are asked for a size BEFORE they are parented getName is overriden to force the name to be ComboBox.renderer if it isn't set. If we didn't do this the wrong style could be used for size calculations. DataModel for Filter ComboboxData model for filter combo-box. Ensure that the current filter is in the list. NOTE: we shouldnt' have to do this, since JFileChooser adds the filter to the choosable filters list when the filter is set. Lets be paranoid just in case someone overrides setFileFilter in JFileChooser. This shouldn't happen.

This is only used by GTKEngine.Maps from a Synth state to the corresponding GTK state.The GTK states are named differently than Synth's states, thefollowing gives the mapping:<table><tr><td>Synth<td>GTK<tr><td>SynthConstants.PRESSED<td>ACTIVE<tr><td>SynthConstants.SELECTED<td>SELECTED<tr><td>SynthConstants.MOUSE_OVER<td>PRELIGHT<tr><td>SynthConstants.DISABLED<td>INSENSITIVE<tr><td>SynthConstants.ENABLED<td>NORMAL</table>Additionally some widgets are special cased. If the button is SELECTED and is PRELIGHT we need to make the state MOUSE_OVER otherwise we don't paint the PRELIGHT. These Regions treat FOREGROUND as TEXT. We need to call super for basic's properties file. SynthTabbedPaneUI supports rollover on tabs, GTK does not Prevents Synth from setting text AA by itself For compatibility with apps expecting certain defaults we'll populate the table with the values from basic.

LABEL in this case.Creates the GTK look and feel class for the passed in Component.Returns the cached gtkThemeNameWe need to call loadGTK() to ensure that the native GTKlibraries are loaded.

On other Unixes (eg Linux) this doesn't apply.REMIND 1: The isSunCJK test is really just a place holderuntil we can properly query fontconfig and use the propertiesset for specific fonts.REMIND 2: See comment on isLocalDisplay() definition regardingXRender.

From:http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/2.0/design-window.html#window-layout-spacingYou'll notice this doesn't do the radiobutton/checkbox borderadjustments that windows/metal do.  This is because gtk doesn'tprovide margins/insets for checkbox/radiobuttons. Checks args Indent group members 12 pixels to denote hierarchy and association. Fall through to related As a basic rule of thumb, leave space between user interface components in increments of 6 pixels, going up as the relationship between related elements becomes more distant. For example, between icon labels and associated graphics within an icon, 6 pixels are adequate. Between labels and associated components, leave 12 horizontal pixels. For vertical spacing between groups of components, 18 pixels is adequate. The first part of this is handled automatically by Icon (which won't give you 6 pixels). A general padding of 12 pixels is recommended between the contents of a dialog window and the window borders./Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/java/swing/plaf/gtk/GTKPainter.javafillAreafillArea(javax.swing.plaf.synth.SynthContext,java.awt.Graphics,int,int,int,int,javax.swing.plaf.synth.ColorType)/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/target/classes/com/sun/java/swing/plaf/gtk/GTKPainter.classpaintIconpaintIcon(javax.swing.plaf.synth.SynthContext,java.awt.Graphics,java.lang.reflect.Method,int,int,int,int,java.lang.Object)paintIcon(javax.swing.plaf.synth.SynthContext,java.awt.Graphics,java.lang.reflect.Method,int,int,int,int)paintMetacityElementpaintMetacityElement(javax.swing.plaf.synth.SynthContext,java.awt.Graphics,int,java.lang.String,int,int,int,int,com.sun.java.swing.plaf.gtk.GTKConstants.ShadowType,com.sun.java.swing.plaf.gtk.GTKConstants.ArrowType)paintFocuspaintFocus(javax.swing.plaf.synth.SynthContext,java.awt.Graphics,javax.swing.plaf.synth.Region,int,java.lang.String,int,int,int,int)paintTreeCellEditorBackgroundpaintTreeCellEditorBackground(javax.swing.plaf.synth.SynthContext,java.awt.Graphics,int,int,int,int)paintTextBackgroundpaintTextBackground(javax.swing.plaf.synth.SynthContext,java.awt.Graphics,int,int,int,int)deriveColorderiveColor(java.awt.Color,int,int)scaleColorComponentscaleColorComponent(int,double)getMaxColorDiffgetMaxColorDiff(java.awt.Color,java.awt.Color)getBrightness(java.awt.Color)paintButtonBackgroundImplpaintButtonBackgroundImpl(javax.swing.plaf.synth.SynthContext,java.awt.Graphics,javax.swing.plaf.synth.Region,java.lang.String,int,int,int,int,boolean,boolean,boolean,boolean)getName(javax.swing.plaf.synth.SynthContext)GTKPainterGTKPainter()ENGINEShadowType[]SHADOWSPositionType[]POSITIONS"handlebox_bin"handlebox_bin"toolbar""Tree.cellEditor"Tree.cellEditorshadow"menuitem"menuitem"TableHeader.renderer"TableHeader.renderer"button"button"InternalFrameTitlePane."InternalFrameTitlePane.paintBGdefaultCapabletoolButtonpaintBackgroundinteriorFocus"interior-focus"interior-focustotalFocusSizexThicknessyThicknesspaintBgdefaultInsets"default-border"default-border"buttondefault"buttondefault"arrow"arrow"ScrollBar.button"ScrollBar.button"TabbedPane.button"TabbedPane.button"vscrollbar"vscrollbar"hscrollbar"hscrollbar"Spinner.nextButton"Spinner.nextButton"Spinner.previousButton"Spinner.previousButton"spinbutton"spinbutton"ComboBox.arrowButton"ComboBox.arrowButton"unexpected name: "unexpected name: "spinbutton_down"spinbutton_down"spinbutton_up"spinbutton_up"spin"spinspinStatemodymodh"shadow-type"shadow-type"menubar"menubaroriginalColororiginalBrightnesstargetBrightnesshighlightColorbackgroundColorminBrightnessmaxBrightnessminBrightnessDifferenceactualBrightnessDifferencehighlightBrightnessbackgroundBrightnessoriginalHighlightBrightnessisHWborder0.8"trough"trough"fg"fg"bar"bar"scrolled_window"scrolled_windowpct0.2f0.2insets"separator""hseparator"hseparator"vseparator"vseparatorfocusedslider"hscale"hscale"vscale"vscalesplitPane"paned"panedpaneselectedIndexgapStartgapSizetabBounds"notebook"notebook"tab"containerParent"entry""entry_bg"entry_bgtoggleButtontroughBorder"trough-border"trough-borderrtl"slider""tooltip"tooltip"cell_odd"cell_odd"treeview"treeview"focus"focus"metacity-arrow"metacity-arrow"metacity-box"metacity-box"metacity-vline"metacity-vlinepaintMethod"expander"expander"radiobutton"radiobutton"check""option""handlebox"handleboxgetContextgetContext(java.awt.Component)/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_251.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/rt.jar/com/sun/java/swing/plaf/gtk/GTKPainter$ListTableFocusBorder.classfocusedCellselectedCelluigetContext(javax.swing.JComponent)/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_251.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/rt.jar/com/sun/java/swing/plaf/gtk/GTKPainter$TitledBorder.classgetStylegetStyle(javax.swing.JComponent)TitledBorder()"frame" Need to support: default_outside_border: Insets when default. interior_focus: Indicates if focus should appear inside border, or                       outside border. focus-line-width: Integer giving size of focus border focus-padding: Integer giving padding between border and focus        indicator. focus-line-pattern: FORMATTED_TEXT_FIELD TOOL_BAR_DRAG_WINDOW TOOL_BAR PASSWORD_FIELD TEXT_FIELD RADIO_BUTTON NOTE: this is called for JCheckBox too RADIO_BUTTON_MENU_ITEM NOTE: this is called for JCheckBoxMenuItem too LABELIf the label is a ListCellRenderer and it's in a container(CellRendererPane) which is in a JComboBox then we paint the labelas a TextField like a gtk_entry for a combobox. INTERNAL_FRAME DESKTOP_PANE Does not call into ENGINE for better performance DESKTOP_ICON Paint the default indicator Render the box. Toolbar buttons should only have their background painted in the PRESSED, SELECTED, or MOUSE_OVER states. Otherwise, always paint the button's background, unless the user has overridden it and we're in the ENABLED state. focus ARROW_BUTTONThe ubuntulooks engine (and presumably others) expect us tofirst draw the full "spinbutton" background, and then drawthe individual "spinbutton_up/down" buttons on top of that.Note that it is the state of the JSpinner (not its arrowbutton) that determines how we draw this background. LIST MENU This is called for both MENU and MENU_ITEM fix no menu borders in Adwaita theme Note that we don't call paintCachedImage() here.  Since the progress bar foreground is painted differently for each value it would be wasteful to try to cache an image for each state, so instead we simply avoid caching in this case. don't bother caching the imageNote: In theory, the style's x/y thickness values would determinethe width of the separator content.  In practice, however, someengines will render a line that is wider than the correspondingthickness value.  For example, ubuntulooks reports x/y thicknessvalues of 1 for separators, but always renders a 2-pixel wide line.As a result of all this, we need to be careful not to restrictthe w/h values below too much, so that the full thickness of therendered line will be captured by our image caching code.GTK renders toolbar separators differently in that anartificial padding is added to each end of the separator.The value of 0.2f below is derived from the source code ofgtktoolbar.c in the current version of GTK+ (2.8.20 at thetime of this writing).  Specifically, the relevant values are:SPACE_LINE_DIVISION 10.0SPACE_LINE_START     2.0SPACE_LINE_END       8.0These are used to determine the distance from the top (or left)edge of the toolbar to the other edge.  So for example, thestarting/top point of a vertical separator is 2/10 of theheight of a horizontal toolbar away from the top edge, whichis how we arrive at 0.2f below.  Likewise, the ending/bottompoint is 8/10 of the height away from the top edge, or in otherwords, it is 2/10 away from the bottom edge, which is againhow we arrive at the 0.2f value below.The separator is also centered horizontally or vertically,depending on its orientation.  This was determined empiricallyand by examining the code referenced above. For regular/menu separators, we simply subtract out the insets. For focused sliders, we paint focus rect outside the bounds passed. Need to adjust for that. The ubuntulooks engine paints slider troughs differently depending on the current slider value and its component orientation. not used for sliders; any value will work Note that we don't call paintCachedImage() here.  Since some engines (e.g. ubuntulooks) paint the slider background differently for any given slider value, it would be wasteful to try to cache an image for each state, so instead we simply avoid caching in this case. SPINNER This is handled in paintTextFieldBackground SPLIT_PANE_DIVIDER TEXT_PANE EDITOR_PANE TEXT_AREA NOTE: Combobox and Label, Password and FormattedTextField calls this too. Text is odd in that it uses the TEXT_BACKGROUND vs BACKGROUND. ROOT_PANE TOGGLE_BUTTON SCROLL_BAR Note: the scrollbar insets already include the "trough-border", which is needed to position the scrollbar buttons properly. But when we render, we need to take the trough border out of the equation so that we paint the entire area covered by the trough border and the scrollbar content itself. SCROLL_BAR_THUMB The clearlooks engine paints scrollbar thumbs differently depending on the current scroll value (specifically, it will avoid rendering a certain line when the thumb is at the starting or ending position).  Therefore, we normalize the current value to the range [0,100] here and then pass it down to setRangeValue() so that the native widget is configured appropriately.  Note that there are really only four values that matter (min, middle, max, or fill) so we restrict to one of those four values to avoid blowing out the image cache. In this case, the thumb fills the entire track, so it is touching both ends at the same time At minimum At maximum Somewhere in between TOOL_TIP TREE_CELL the string arg should alternate based on row being painted, but we currently don't pass that in. TREE As far as I can tell, these don't call into the ENGINE. VIEWPORT Also note that you don't want this to call into the ENGINE as if it where to paint a background JViewport wouldn't scroll All icon painting methods are called from under GTK_LOCK The orientation parameter passed down by Synth refers to the orientation of the toolbar, but the one we pass to GTK refers to the orientation of the handle.  Therefore, we need to swap the value here: horizontal toolbars have vertical handles, and vice versa.Fill an area with color determined from this context's Style using thespecified GTKColorType Refer to GTKLookAndFeel for details on this.

If <code>insets</code> is non-null the resultinginsets will be placed in it, otherwise a new Insets object will becreated and returned.Where to place InsetsInsets. The following calculations are derived from gtkbutton.c (GTK+ version 2.8.20), gtk_button_size_allocate() method. Include the default border insets, but only for JButtons that are default capable.  Note that JButton.getDefaultCapable() returns true by default, but GtkToolButtons are never default capable, so we skip this step if the button is contained in a toolbar.This is used for both RADIO_BUTTON and CHECK_BOX. The following calculations are derived from gtkcheckbutton.c (GTK+ version 2.8.20), gtk_check_button_size_allocate() method. Note: GTKIconFactory.DelegateIcon will have already included the "indicator-spacing" value in the size of the indicator icon, which explains why we use zero as the left inset (or right inset in the RTL case); see 6489585 for more details. The following calculations are derived from gtkmenubar.c (GTK+ version 2.8.20), gtk_menu_bar_size_allocate() method. The following calculations are derived from gtkmenuitem.c (GTK+ version 2.8.20), gtk_menu_item_size_allocate() method. NOTE: this is called for ComboBox, and FormattedTextField also This scrollbar is part of a scrollpane; use only the "scrollbar-spacing" style property to determine the padding between the scrollbar and its parent scrollpane. This is a standalone scrollbar; leave enough room for the focus line in addition to the trough border.Returns the value for a class specific property for a particularWidgetType.  This method is useful in those cases where we need tofetch a value for a Region that is not associated with the componentcurrently in use (e.g. we need to figure out the insets for aSCROLL_BAR, but certain values can only be extracted from aSCROLL_PANE region).WidgetType for which to fetch the valueKey identifying class specific valueValue, or null if one has not been definedConvenience method to get a class specific integer value fora particular WidgetType.Returned if there is no value for the specifiedValue, or defaultValue if <code>key</code> is not definedReturns the value for a class specific property.

See if this is a class specific value.This is a workaround as the "slider-length" property has beendeprecated for GtkScale from gtk 3.20, so default value of 31is used and makes redering of slider wrong. Value 14 is beingused as default value for Slider.thumbHeight is 14 and makingwidth 14 as well makes slider thumb render in proper shape Is it a specific value ?This is a workaround as the "min-slider-length" property has beendeprecated for GtkScrollBar from gtk 3.20, so default value of 21is used and makes ScrollBar thumb very small. Value 40 is beingused as this is the value mentioned in css files Believe it or not, the size of a spinner arrow button is dependent upon the size of the spinner's font.  These calculations come from gtkspinbutton.c (version 2.8.20), spin_button_get_arrow_size() method. For all other kinds of arrow buttons (e.g. combobox arrow buttons), we will simply fall back on the value of ArrowButton.size as defined in the UIDefaults for GTKLookAndFeel when we call UIManager.get() below... The iconTextGap value needs to include "indicator-spacing" and it also needs to leave enough space for the focus line, which falls between the indicator icon and the text. See getRadioInsets() and 6489585 for more details. Is it a stock icon ? Is it another kind of value ? For backward compatibility we'll fallback to the UIManager. We don't go to the UIManager for engine as the engine is GTK specific. Don't call super, we don't want to pick up defaults from SynthStyle. First try loading a theme-specific icon using the native GTK libraries (native GTK handles the resizing for us). In a failure case where native GTK (unexpectedly) returns a null icon, we can try loading a default icon as a fallback. In an extreme failure situation, just return null (callers are already prepared to handle a null icon, so the worst that can happen is that an icon won't be included in the button/dialog).

This value is also made available as the Xft.dpi X resource.This is presumably a function of the font preferences API and/orthe manner in which it requests the toolkit to update the defaultfor the desktop. This dual approach is probably necessary sinceother versions of GTK - or perhaps some apps - determine the sizeto use only at start-up from that X resource.If that resource is not set then GTK scales for the DPI resolutionreported by the Xserver using the formulaDisplayHeight(dpy, screen) / DisplayHeightMM(dpy, screen) * 25.4(25.4mm == 1 inch).JDK tracks the Xft.dpi XSETTINGS property directly so it candynamically change font size by tracking just that value.If that resource is not available use the same fall back formulaas GTK (see calculation for fontScale).GTK's default setting for Xft.dpi is 96 dpi (and it seems -1apparently also can mean that "default"). However this defaultisn't used if there's no property set. The real default in theabsence of a resource is the Xserver reported dpi.Finally this DPI is used to calculate the nearest Java 2D font72 dpi font size.There are cases in which JDK behaviour may not exactly mimicGTK native app behaviour :1) When a GTK app is not able to dynamically track the changes(does not use XSETTINGS), JDK will resize but other apps willnot. This is OK as JDK is exhibiting preferred behaviour andthis is probably how all later GTK apps will behave2) When a GTK app does not use XSETTINGS and for some reasonthe XRDB property is not present. JDK will pick up XSETTINGSand the GTK app will use the Xserver default. Since itsimpossible for JDK to know that some other GTK app is notusing XSETTINGS its impossible to account for this and in anycase for it to be a problem the values would have to be different.It also seems unlikely to arise except when a user explicitlydeletes the X resource database entry.There also some other issues to be aware of for the future:GTK specifies the Xft.dpi value as server-wide which when usedon systems with 2 distinct X screens with different physical DPIthe font sizes will inevitably appear different. It would havebeen a more user-friendly design to further adjust that onesetting depending on the screen resolution to achieve perceivedequivalent sizes. If such a change were ever to be made in GTKwe would need to update for that.50 dpi is the minimum value gnome allowsThe Java rasteriser assumes pts are in a user space of72 dpi, so we need to adjust for that.If there's no property, GTK scales for the resolutionreported by the Xserver using the formula listed above.fontScale already accounts for the 72 dpi Java 2D space.Round size to nearest integer pt sizefamily is a Fc/Pango logical font which we need to expand.It's a physical font which we will create with a fallbacka roundabout way to set the font size in floating pointsthe (unscaled) font size as an integer.the size of the font described by pangoName (e.g. ifpangoName is "Sans Italic 10", then this method returns

All rights reserved.A class to help mimic Vista theme animations.  The only kind ofanimation it handles for now is 'transition' animation (this seemsto be the only animation which Vista theme can do). This is whenone picture fadein over another one in some period of time.According tohttps://connect.microsoft.com/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=86852&SiteID=4The animations are all linear.This class has a number of responsibilities.<li> It trigger rapaint for the UI components involved in the animation<li> It tracks the animation state for every UI component involved in theanimation and paints {@code Skin} in new {@code State} over the{@code Skin} in last {@code State} using{@code AlphaComposite.SrcOver.derive(alpha)} where {code alpha}depends on the state of animationIgor Kushnirskiythis timer is used to cause repaint on animated components30 repaints per second should give smooth animation affectwe need to dispose the controller on l&f changeidk: we can not handle tabs animation becausethe same (component,part) is used to handle all the tabsand we can not track the statesVista theme might have transition duration for toolbar buttonsbut native application does not seem to animate them it seems for DEFAULTED button state Vista does animation from HOTOnly button might have DEFAULTED stateidk: do not know how to get the value from Vistaone second seems plausible value for scrollbar up, down, left and right button pictures are defined by states.

If the underlying desktop property changes thiswill force the UIs to update all known Frames. You can invoke<code>invalidate</code> to force the value to be fetched again. NOTE: Don't rely on this class staying in this location. It is likely to move to a different package in the future.Indicates if an updateUI call is pending.ReferenceQueue of unreferenced WeakPCLs.PropertyChangeListener attached to the Toolkit.Key used to lookup value from desktop.Value to return.Fallback value in case we get null from desktop.Cleans up any lingering state held by unrefeerncedDesktopProperties.Sets whether or not an updateUI call is pending.Returns true if a UI update is pending.Updates the UIs of all the known Frames. Check if the current UI is WindowsLookAndfeel and flush the XP style map. Note: Change the package test if this class is moved to a different package.Updates the UI of the passed in window and all its children.Creates a DesktopProperty.Key used in looking up desktop value.Value used if desktop property is null. The only sure fire way to clear our references is to create a Thread and wait for a reference to be added to the queue. Because it is so rare that you will actually change the look and feel, this stepped is forgoed and a middle ground of flushing references from the constructor is instead done. The implication is that once one DesktopProperty is created there will most likely be n (number of DesktopProperties created by the LookAndFeel) WeakPCLs around, but this number will not grow past n.UIManager.LazyValue method, returns the value from the desktopor the fallback value if the desktop value is null.Returns the value from the desktop.Returns the value to use if the desktop property is null.Invalidates the current value.the LookAndFeel this DesktopProperty was created withInvalides the current value so that the next invocation of<code>createValue</code> will ask for the property again.Requests that all components in the GUI hierarchy be updatedto reflect dynamic changes in this look&feel.

In general,LR parsers are a form of bottom up shift-reduce parsers.  Shift-reduceparsers act by shifting input onto a parse stack until the Symbolsmatching the right hand side of a production appear on the top of thestack.  Once this occurs, a reduce is performed.  This involves removingthe Symbols corresponding to the right hand side of the production(the so called "handle") and replacing them with the non-terminal fromthe left hand side of the production.  <p>To control the decision of whether to shift or reduce at any given point,the parser uses a state machine (the "viable prefix recognition machine"built by the parser generator).  The current state of the machine is placedon top of the parse stack (stored as part of a Symbol object representinga terminal or non terminal).  The parse action table is consulted(using the current state and the current lookahead Symbol as indexes) todetermine whether to shift or to reduce.  When the parser shifts, itchanges to a new state by pushing a new Symbol (containing a new state)onto the stack.  When the parser reduces, it pops the handle (right handside of a production) off the stack.  This leaves the parser in the stateit was in before any of those Symbols were matched.  Next the reduce-gototable is consulted (using the new state and current lookahead Symbol asindexes) to determine a new state to go to.  The parser then shifts tothis goto state by pushing the left hand side Symbol of the production(also containing the new state) onto the stack.<p>This class actually provides four LR parsers.  The methods parse() anddebug_parse() provide two versions of the main parser (the only differencebeing that debug_parse() emits debugging trace messages as it parses).In addition to these main parsers, the error recovery mechanism uses twomore.  One of these is used to simulate "parsing ahead" in the inputwithout carrying out actions (to verify that a potential error recoveryhas worked), and the other is used to parse through buffered "parse ahead"input in order to execute all actions and re-synchronize the actual parserconfiguration.<p>This is an abstract class which is normally filled out by a subclassgenerated by the JavaCup parser generator.  In addition to supplyingthe actual parse tables, generated code also supplies methods whichinvoke various pieces of user supplied code, provide access to certainspecial Symbols (e.g., EOF and error), etc.  Specifically, the followingabstract methods are normally supplied by generated code:<dl compact><dt> short[][] production_table()<dd> Provides a reference to the production table (indicating the index ofthe left hand side non terminal and the length of the right hand sidefor each production in the grammar).<dt> short[][] action_table()<dd> Provides a reference to the parse action table.<dt> short[][] reduce_table()<dd> Provides a reference to the reduce-goto table.<dt> int start_state()<dd> Indicates the index of the start state.<dt> int start_production()<dd> Indicates the index of the starting production.<dt> int EOF_sym()<dd> Indicates the index of the EOF Symbol.<dt> int error_sym()<dd> Indicates the index of the error Symbol.<dt> Symbol do_action()<dd> Executes a piece of user supplied action code.  This always comes atthe point of a reduce in the parse, so this code also allocates andfills in the left hand side non terminal Symbol object that is to bepushed onto the stack for the reduce.<dt> void init_actions()<dd> Code to initialize a special object that encapsulates user suppliedactions (this object is used by do_action() to actually carry out theactions).</dl>In addition to these routines that <i>must</i> be supplied by thegenerated subclass there are also a series of routines that <i>may</i>be supplied.  These include:<dl><dt> Symbol scan()<dd> Used to get the next input Symbol from the scanner.<dt> Scanner getScanner()<dd> Used to provide a scanner for the default implementation ofscan().<dt> int error_sync_size()<dd> This determines how many Symbols past the point of an errormust be parsed without error in order to consider a recovery tobe valid.  This defaults to 3.  Values less than 2 are notrecommended.<dt> void report_error(String message, Object info)<dd> This method is called to report an error.  The default implementationsimply prints a message to System.err and where the error occurred.This method is often replaced in order to provide a more sophisticatederror reporting mechanism.<dt> void report_fatal_error(String message, Object info)<dd> This method is called when a fatal error that cannot be recovered fromis encountered.  In the default implementation, it callsreport_error() to emit a message, then throws an exception.<dt> void syntax_error(Symbol cur_token)<dd> This method is called as soon as syntax error is detected (butbefore recovery is attempted).

This table isindexed by state and terminal number indicating what action is tobe taken when the parser is in the given state (i.e., the given stateis on top of the stack) and the given terminal is next on the input.States are indexed using the first dimension, however, the entries fora given state are compacted and stored in adjacent index, value pairswhich are searched for rather than accessed directly (see get_action()).The actions stored in the table will be either shifts, reduces, orerrors.  Shifts are encoded as positive values (one greater than thestate shifted to).  Reduces are encoded as negative values (one lessthan the production reduced by).

Typically thisinitializes the scanner.  This is called before the parser requeststhe first Symbol.  Here this is just a placeholder for subclasses thatmight need this and we perform no action.   This method is normallyoverridden by the generated code using this contents of the "init with"clause as its body.Initialize the action object.  This is called before the parser doesany parse actions. This is filled in by generated code to createan object that encapsulates all action code.Get the next Symbol from the input (supplied by generated subclass).Once end of file has been reached, all subsequent calls to scanshould return an EOF Symbol (which is Symbol number 0).  By defaultthis method returns getScanner().next_token(); this implementationcan be overriden by the generated parser using the code declared inthe "scan with" clause.  Do not recycle objects; every call toscan() should return a fresh object.Report a fatal error.  This method takes a  message string and anadditional object (to be used by specializations implemented insubclasses).  Here in the base class a very simple implementationis provided which reports the error then throws an exception.an error message.an extra object reserved for use by specialized subclasses.stop parsing (not really necessary since we throw an exception, but)use the normal error message reporting to put out the messagethrow an exceptionReport a non fatal error (or warning).  This method takes a messagestring and an additional object (to be used by specializationsimplemented in subclasses).  Here in the base class a very simpleimplementation is provided which simply prints the message toSystem.err.This method is called when a syntax error has been detected and recoveryis about to be invoked.  Here in the base class we just emit a"Syntax error" error message.the current lookahead Symbol.This method is called if it is determined that syntax error recoveryhas been unsuccessful.  Here in the base class we report a fatal error.Fetch an action from the action table.  The table is broken up intorows, one per state (rows are indexed directly by state number).Within each row, a list of index, value pairs are given (as sequentialentries in the table), and the list is terminated by a default entry(denoted with a Symbol index of -1).  To find the proper entry in a rowwe do a linear or binary search (depending on the size of the row).the state index of the action being accessed.the Symbol index of the action being accessed.linear search if we are < 10 entriesis this entry labeled with our Symbol or the default?return the next entryotherwise binary searchleave out trailing default entrynot found, use the default at the endshouldn't happened, but if we run off the end we return thedefault (error == 0)Fetch a state from the reduce-goto table.

It returns only whendone_parsing() has been called (typically because the parser hasaccepted, or a fatal error has been reported).

This does exactly thesame things as parse(), except that it calls debug_shift() anddebug_reduce() when shift and reduce moves are taken by the parserand produces various other debugging messages.the current Symboldebug_stack();Error recovery codeAttempt to recover from a syntax error.  This returns false if recoveryfails, true if it succeeds.  Recovery happens in 4 steps.  First wepop the parse stack down to a point at which we have a shift outof the top-most state on the error Symbol.  This represents theinitial error recovery configuration.  If no such configuration isfound, then we fail.  Next a small number of "lookahead" or "parseahead" Symbols are read into a buffer.  The size of this buffer isdetermined by error_sync_size() and determines how many Symbols beyondthe error must be matched to consider the recovery a success.  Next,we begin to discard Symbols in attempt to get past the point of errorto a point where we can continue parsing.  After each Symbol, we attemptto "parse ahead" though the buffered lookahead Symbols.  The "parse ahead"process simulates that actual parse, but does not modify the realparser's configuration, nor execute any actions. If we can  parse allthe stored Symbols without error, then the recovery is considered asuccess.  Once a successful recovery point is determined, we do anactual parse over the stored input -- modifying the real parseconfiguration and executing all actions.  Finally, we return the thenormal parser to continue with the overall parse.should we produce debugging messages as we parse.first pop the stack back into a state that can shift on error anddo that shift (if that fails, we fail)read ahead to create lookahead we can parse multiple timesrepeatedly try to parse forward until we make it the required disttry to parse forward, if it makes it, bail out of loopif we are now at EOF, we have failedotherwise, we consume another Symbol and try againwe have consumed to a point where we can parse forwarddo the real parse (including actions) across the lookaheadwe have successDetermine if we can shift under the special error Symbol out of thestate currently on the top of the (real) parse stack.is there a shift under error SymbolPut the (real) parse stack into error recovery configuration bypopping the stack down to a state that can shift on the specialerror Symbol, then doing the shift.

For example, the standard doclet is calledby default and writes out documentation to HTML files.The invocation is defined by the abstract {@link com.sun.javadoc.Doclet} class-- the entry point is the {@link com.sun.javadoc.Doclet#start(RootDoc) start} method:public static boolean <b>start</b>(RootDoc root)The {@link com.sun.javadoc.RootDoc} instance holds the root of the program structureinformation. From this root all other program structureinformation can be extracted.<a name="terminology"></a><h3>Terminology</h3><a name="included"></a>When calling javadoc, you pass in package names and source file names --these are called the <em>specified</em> packages and classes.You also pass in Javadoc options; the <em>access control</em> Javadoc options(<code>-public</code>, <code>-protected</code>, <code>-package</code>,and <code>-private</code>) filter program elements, producing aresult set, called the <em>included</em> set, or "documented" set.(The unfiltered set is also available through{@link com.sun.javadoc.PackageDoc#allClasses(boolean) allClasses(false)}.)<a name="class"></a>Throughout this API, the term <em>class</em> is normally ashorthand for "class or interface", as in: {@link com.sun.javadoc.ClassDoc},{@link com.sun.javadoc.PackageDoc#allClasses() allClasses()}, and{@link com.sun.javadoc.PackageDoc#findClass(String) findClass(String)}.In only a couple of other places, it means "class, as opposed to interface",as in:  {@link com.sun.javadoc.Doc#isClass()}.In the second sense, this API calls out four kinds of classes:{@linkplain com.sun.javadoc.Doc#isOrdinaryClass() ordinary classes},{@linkplain com.sun.javadoc.Doc#isEnum() enums},{@linkplain com.sun.javadoc.Doc#isError() errors} and{@linkplain com.sun.javadoc.Doc#isException() exceptions}.Throughout the API, the detailed description of each program elementdescribes explicitly which meaning is being used.<a name="qualified"></a>A <em>qualified</em> class or interface name is one that has its packagename prepended to it, such as <code>java.lang.String</code>.

Itcontains the methods necessary for the creation, registration, anddeletion of MBeans as well as the access methods for registered MBeans.This is the core component of the JMX infrastructure.Every MBean which is added to the MBean server becomes manageable: its attributes and operationsbecome remotely accessible through the connectors/adaptors connected to that MBean server.A Java object cannot be registered in the MBean server unless it is a JMX compliant MBean.When an MBean is registered or unregistered in the MBean server an{@link javax.management.MBeanServerNotification MBeanServerNotification}Notification is emitted. To register an object as listener to MBeanServerNotificationsyou should call the MBean server method {@link #addNotificationListener addNotificationListener} with <CODE>ObjectName</CODE>the <CODE>ObjectName</CODE> of the {@link javax.management.MBeanServerDelegate MBeanServerDelegate}.This <CODE>ObjectName</CODE> is:<CODE>JMImplementation:type=MBeanServerDelegate</CODE>.The MBeanInstantiator object used by theDefaultMBeanServerInterceptorThe MBean server object that is associated to theThe MBean server delegate object that is associated to theThe Repository object used by the DefaultMBeanServerInterceptorWrappers for client listeners.See the comment before addNotificationListener below.The default domain of the object namesThe sequence number identifying the notifications sent Now sequence number is handled by MBeanServerDelegate. private int sequenceNumber=0;Creates a DefaultMBeanServerInterceptor with the specifiedrepository instance.<p>Do not forget to call <code>initialize(outer,delegate)</code>before using this object.A pointer to the MBeanServer object that must bepassed to the MBeans when invoking their{@link javax.management.MBeanRegistration} interface.A pointer to the MBeanServerDelegate associatedwith the new MBeanServer.

Check that the MBean can be instantiated by the MBeanServer. Check the JMX MBean compliance of the class ------------------------------ Includes case where getMBeanInfo() returns nullThe semantics of preDeregister are tricky.  If it throws anexception, then the unregisterMBean fails.  This allows anMBean to refuse to be unregistered.  If it returnssuccessfully, then the unregisterMBean can proceed.  Inthis case the preDeregister may have cleaned up some state,and will not expect to be called a second time.  So if twothreads try to unregister the same MBean at the same timethen one of them must wait for the other one to either (a)call preDeregister and get an exception or (b) callpreDeregister successfully and unregister the MBean.Suppose thread T1 is unregistering an MBean and thread T2is trying to unregister the same MBean, so waiting for T1.Then a deadlock is possible if the preDeregister for T1ends up needing a lock held by T2.  Given the semanticsjust described, there does not seem to be any way to avoidthis.  This will not happen to code where it is clear forany given MBean what thread may unregister that MBean.On the other hand we clearly do not want a thread that isunregistering MBean A to have to wait for another threadthat is unregistering another MBean B (see bug 6318664).  Adeadlock in this situation could reasonably be consideredgratuitous.  So holding a global lock across thepreDeregister call would be bad.So we have a set of ObjectNames that some thread iscurrently unregistering.  When a thread wants to unregistera name, it must first check if the name is in the set, andif so it must wait.  When a thread successfully unregistersa name it removes the name from the set and notifies anywaiting threads that the set has changed.This implies that we must be very careful to ensure thatthe name is removed from the set and waiters notified, nomatter what code path is taken. pretend the exception came from preDeregister; in another execution sequence it could have may throw InstanceNotFoundException Unregisters the MBean from the repository. Returns the resource context that was used. The returned context does nothing for regular MBeans. For ClassLoader MBeans and JMXNamespace (and JMXDomain) MBeans - the context makes it possible to unregister these objects from the appropriate framework artifacts, such as the CLR or the dispatcher, from within the repository lock. In case of success, we also need to call context.done() at the Check if the caller has the right to invoke 'queryMBeans' Perform query without "query". on each specific classname/objectname in the list.

For ClassLoader MBeans the context makes it possible to register these objects with the appropriate framework artifacts, such as the CLR, from within the repository lock. neither Error nor Exception??Gets a specific MBean controlled by the DefaultMBeanServerInterceptor.The name must have a non-default domain.The ObjectName looks like ":a=b", and that's what itstoString() will return in this implementation.  Sowe can just stick the default domain in front of itto get a non-default-domain name.  We depend on thefact that toString() works like that and that itleaves wildcards in place (so we can detect an errorif one is supplied where it shouldn't be).Notification handling.This is not trivial, because the MBeanServer translates thesource of a received notification from a reference to an MBeaninto the ObjectName of that MBean.  While that does makenotification sending easier for MBean writers, it comes at aconsiderable cost.  We need to replace the source of anotification, which is basically wrong if there are alsolisteners registered directly with the MBean (without goingthrough the MBean server).  We also need to wrap the listenersupplied by the client of the MBeanServer with a listener thatperforms the substitution before forwarding.  This is why westrongly discourage people from putting MBean references in thesource of their notifications.  Instead they should arrange toput the ObjectName there themselves.However, existing code relies on the substitution, so we arestuck with it.Here's how we handle it.  When you add a listener, we make aListenerWrapper around it.  We look that up in thelistenerWrappers map, and if there was already a wrapper forthat listener with the given ObjectName, we reuse it.  This mapis a WeakHashMap, so a listener that is no longer registeredwith any MBean can be garbage collected.We cannot use simpler solutions such as always creating a newwrapper or always registering the same listener with the MBeanand using the handback to find the client's original listener.The reason is that we need to support the removeListenervariant that removes all (listener,filter,handback) triples ona broadcaster that have a given listener.  And we do not haveany way to inspect a broadcaster's internal list of triples.So the same client listener must always map to the samelistener registered with the broadcaster.Another possible solution would be to map from ObjectName tolist of listener wrappers (or IdentityHashMap of listenerwrappers), making this list the first time a listener is addedon a given MBean, and removing it when the MBean is removed.This is probably more costly in memory, but could be useful ifsome day we don't want to rely on weak references. ------------------ Check listener ---------------- Get listener object Add a listener on an MBeanWe could simplify the code by assigning broadcaster afterassigning listenerWrapper, but that would change the errorbehavior when both the broadcaster and the listener areerroneous.Could be SecurityException or ClassNotFoundException<p>Return the {@link java.lang.ClassLoader} that was used forloading the class of the named MBean.The ObjectName of the MBean.The ClassLoader used for that MBean.InstanceNotFoundExceptionif the named MBean is not found.<p>Return the named {@link java.lang.ClassLoader}.The ObjectName of the ClassLoader.The named ClassLoader.if the named ClassLoaderis not found.Check if the given MBean is a ClassLoaderSends an MBeanServerNotifications with the specified type for theMBean with the specified ObjectName --------------------- Create notificationApplies the specified queries to the set of NamedObjects. No query ... Access the filterquery.setMBeanServer is probablyQueryEval.setMBeanServer so put back the oldvalue.  Since that method uses a ThreadLocalvariable, this code is only needed for theunusual case where the user creates a customQueryExp that calls a nested query on anotherMBeanServer.Applies the specified queries to the set of ObjectInstances. Null query. Access the filter.Get the existing wrapper for this listener, name, and mbean, ifthere is one.  Otherwise, if "create" is true, create andreturn one.  Otherwise, return null.We use a WeakHashMap so that if the only reference to a userlistener is in listenerWrappers, it can be garbage collected.This requires a certain amount of care, because only the key ina WeakHashMap is weak; the value is strong.  We need to recoverthe existing wrapper object (not just an object that is equalto it), so we would like listenerWrappers to map anyListenerWrapper to the canonical ListenerWrapper for that(listener,name,mbean) set.  But we do not want this canonicalwrapper to be referenced strongly.  Therefore we put it insidea WeakReference and that is the value in the WeakHashMap.Listeners are not supposed to throw exceptions.  Ifthis one does, we could remove it from the MBean.  Itmight indicate that a connector has stopped working,for instance, and there is no point in sending futurenotifications over that connection.  However, thisseems rather drastic, so instead we propagate theexception and let the broadcaster handle it.We compare all three, in case the same MBean objectgets unregistered and then reregistered under adifferent name, or the same name gets assigned to twodifferent MBean objects at different times.  We do thecomparisons in this order to avoid the slowObjectName.equals when possible.We do not include name.hashCode() in the hash becausecomputing it is slow and usually we will not have twoinstances of ListenerWrapper with the same mbean butdifferent ObjectNames.  That can happen if the MBean isunregistered from one name and reregistered withanother, and there is no garbage collection between; orif the same object is registered under two names (whichis not recommended because MBeanRegistration willbreak).  But even in these unusual cases the hash codedoes not have to be unique.

OK: must not be a primitive wrapper Should not reach hereGet the converter for the given Java type, creating it if necessary.It's not yet worth formalizing these tests by having for examplean array of factory classes, each of which says whether itrecognizes the Type (Chain of Responsibility pattern). Huge hack to avoid compiler warnings here.  The ElementType parameter is ignored but allows us to obtain a type variable T that matches <T extends Enum<T>>.Make the converter for an array type, or a collection such asList<String> or Set<Integer>.  We never see one-dimensionalprimitive arrays (e.g. int[]) here because they use the identityconverter and are registered as such in the static initializer.We know how to translate List<E>, Set<E>, SortedSet<E>,Map<K,V>, SortedMap<K,V>, and that's it.  We don't acceptsubtypes of those because we wouldn't know how to deserializethem.  We don't accept Queue<E> because it is unlikely peoplewould use that as a parameter or return type in an MBean. For historical reasons GcInfo implements CompositeData but we shouldn't count its CompositeData.getCompositeType() field as an item in the computed CompositeType.Select public methods that look like "T getX()" or "booleanisX()", where T is not void and X is not the emptystring.  Exclude "Class getClass()" inherited from Object. field names field descriptionsConverter for classes where the open data is identical to theoriginal data.  This is true for any of the SimpleType types,and for an any-dimension array of those.  It is also true forprimitive types as of JMX 1.3, since an int[]can be directly represented by an ArrayType, and an int needs no mappingbecause reflection takes care of it.DefaultMXBeanMappingFactory for the elements of this array.  If this is anarray of arrays, the converter converts the second-level arrays,not the deepest elements.Determine the concrete class to be used when convertingback to this Java type.  We convert all Lists to ArrayListand all Sets to TreeSet.  (TreeSet because it is a SortedSet,so works for both Set and SortedSet.)Determine how to convert back from the CompositeData intothe original Java type.  For a type that is not reconstructible,this method will fail every time, and will throw the rightexception.In this 2D array, each subarray is a set of builders wherethere is no point in consulting the ones after the first ifthe first refuses.We try to make a meaningful exception message byconcatenating each Builder's explanation of why itisn't applicable. skip other builders in this groupConverts from a CompositeData to an instance of the targetClass.If the subclass is appropriate for targetClass, then themethod returns null.  If the subclass is not appropriate,then the method returns an explanation of why not.  If thesubclass should be appropriate but there is a problem,then the method throws InvalidObjectException.If the subclass returns an explanation of why it is not applicable,it can additionally indicate an exception with details.  This ispotentially confusing, because the real problem could be that oneof the other subclasses is supposed to be applicable but isn't.But the advantage of less information loss probably outweighs thedisadvantage of possible confusion.Builder for when the target class has a method "public staticfrom(CompositeData)". See if it has a method "T from(CompositeData)" as is conventional for a CompositeDataView success! OK: it doesn't have the methodThis builder never actually returns success.  It simply servesto check whether the other builders in the same group have anychance of success.  If any getter in the targetClass returnsa type that we don't know how to reconstruct, then we willnot be able to make a builder, and there is no point in repeatingthe error about the problematic getter as many times as there arecandidate builders.  Instead, the "applicable" method will returnan explanatory string, and the other builders will be skipped.If all the getters are OK, then the "applicable" method will returnan empty string and the other builders will be tried.Builder for when the target class has a setter for every getter.Builder for when the target class has a constructor that isannotated with @ConstructorProperties so we can see the correspondenceto getters. java.beans not present should not reach here Applicable if and only if there are any annotated constructors Now check that all the annotated constructors are valid and throw an exception if not. First link the itemNames to their getter indexes. Run through the constructors making the checks in the spec. For each constructor, remember the correspondence between its parameters and the items.  The int[] for a constructor says what parameter index should get what item.  For example, if element 0 is 2 then that means that item 0 in the CompositeData goes to parameter 2 of the constructor.  If an element is -1, that item isn't given to the constructor. Also remember the set of properties in that constructor so we can test unambiguity.Check that no possible set of items could lead to an ambiguouschoice of constructor (spec requires this check).  For anypair of constructors, their union would be the minimalambiguous set.  If this set itself corresponds to a constructor,there is no ambiguity for that pair.  In the usual case, oneof the constructors is a superset of the other so the union isjust the bigger constructor.The algorithm here is quadratic in the number of constructorswith a @ConstructorProperties annotation.  Typically this correspondsto the number of versions of the class there have been.  Tenwould already be a large number, so although it's probablypossible to have an O(n lg n) algorithm it wouldn't beworth the complexity. The CompositeData might come from an earlier version where not all the items were present.  We look for a constructor that accepts just the items that are present.  Because of the ambiguity check in applicable(), we know there must be at most one maximally applicable constructor.Builder for when the target class is an interface and containsno methods other than getters.  Then we can make an instanceusing a dynamic proxy that forwards the getters to the sourceCompositeData.If the interface has any methods left over, they better bepublic methods that are already present in java.lang.Object.We don't catch SecurityException since it shouldn'thappen for a method in Object and if it does we wouldlike to know about it rather than mysteriously complaining.Utility method to take a string and convert it to normal Java variablename capitalization.  This normally means converting the firstcharacter from upper case to lower case, but in the (unusual) specialcase when there is more than one character and both the first andsecond characters are upper case, we leave it alone.Thus "FooBah" becomes "fooBah" and "X" becomes "x", but "URL" staysas "URL".The string to be decapitalized.The decapitalized version of the string.

This makes it possible to determine whethera method overrides another one simply by looking at the method(s)that precedes it in the list. (see eliminateCovariantMethods). Super type comes first: Object, Number, Integer could assert bret.isAssignableFrom(aret)Eliminate methods that are overridden with a covariant return type.Reflection will return both the original and the overriding methodbut only the overriding one is of interest.  We return the methodsin the same order they arrived in.  This isn't required by the specbut existing code may depend on it and users may be used to seeingoperations or attributes appear in a particular order.Because of the way this method works, if the same Method appearsmore than once in the given List then it will be completely deleted!So don't do that. We are assuming that you never have very many methods with the same name, so it is OK to use algorithms that are quadratic in the number of methods with the same name. Methods that don't have the same name can't override each other Methods that have the same name and same signature override each other.

There is one instanceof this class for Standard MBeans, and one for every MXBeanMappingFactory;these two cases correspond to the two concrete subclasses of this abstractclass.the representation of methods for this kind of MBean:Method for Standard MBeans, ConvertingMethod for MXBeans.Using a type parameter <M> allows us to deal with the fact thatMethod and ConvertingMethod have no useful common ancestor, onwhich we could call getName, getGenericReturnType, etc.  A simpler approachwould be to wrap every Method in an object that does have a commonancestor with ConvertingMethod.  But that would mean an extra objectfor every Method in every Standard MBean interface.The map from interface to PerInterface for this type of MBean.The map from concrete implementation class and interface toMBeanInfo for this type of MBean.Make an interface analyzer for this type of MBean.True if MBeans with this kind of introspector are MXBeans.Find the M corresponding to the given Method.Get the name of this method.Get the return type of this method.  This is the return typeof a method in a Java interface, so for MXBeans it is thedeclared Java type, not the mapped Open Type.Get the parameter types of this method in the Java interfaceit came from.Get the signature of this method as a caller would have to supplyit in MBeanServer.invoke.  For MXBeans, the named types will bethe mapped Open Types for the parameters.Check that this method is valid.  For example, a method in anMXBean interface is not valid if one of its parameters cannot bemapped to an Open Type.Invoke the method with the given target and arguments.Additional information about the target.  For anMXBean, this is the MXBeanLookup associated with the MXBean.It would be cleaner if the type of the cookie were atype parameter to this class, but that would involve a lot ofmessy type parameter propagation just to avoid a couple of casts.Test whether the given value is valid for the given parameter of thisM.Construct an MBeanAttributeInfo for the given attribute based on thegiven getter and setter.  One but not both of the getter and settermay be null.Construct an MBeanOperationInfo for the given operation based onthe M it was derived from.Get a Descriptor containing fields that MBeans of this kind willalways have.  For example, MXBeans will always have "mxbean=true".Get a Descriptor containing additional fields beyond the onesfrom getBasicMBeanDescriptor that MBeans whose concrete classis resourceClass will always have.Get the methods to be analyzed to build the MBean interface.Make the MBeanInfo skeleton for the given MBean interface usingthe given analyzer.  This will never be the MBeanInfo of any realMBean (because the getClassName() must be a concrete class), butits MBeanAttributeInfo[] and MBeanOperationInfo[] can be insertedinto such an MBeanInfo, and its Descriptor can be the basis forthe MBeanInfo's Descriptor.True if the given getter and setter are consistent.Invoke the given M on the given target with the given args and cookie.Wrap exceptions appropriately.We do not catch and wrap RuntimeException or Error,because we're in a DynamicMBean, so the logic for DynamicMBeanswill do the wrapping.Invoke the given setter on the given target with the given argumentand cookie.  Wrap exceptions appropriately.If the value is of the wrong type for the method we are about toinvoke, we are supposed to throw an InvalidAttributeValueException.Rather than making the check always, we invoke the method, thenif it throws an exception we check the type to see if that waswhat caused the exception.  The assumption is that an exceptionfrom an invalid type will arise before any user method is evercalled (either in reflection or in OpenConverter). Following is expensive but we only call this method to determine if an exception is due to an incompatible parameter type. Plain old c.isInstance doesn't work for primitive types.A visitor that constructs the per-interface MBeanInfo.Make an MBeanInfo based on the attributes and operationsfound in the interface.Looking up the MBeanInfo for a given base class (implementation class)is complicated by the fact that we may use the same base class withseveral different explicit MBean interfaces via thejavax.management.StandardMBean class.  It is further complicatedby the fact that we have to be careful not to retain a strong referenceto any Class object for fear we would prevent a ClassLoader from beinggarbage-collected.  So we have a first lookup from the base classto a map for each interface that base class might specify givingthe MBeanInfo constructed for that base class and interface.Return the MBeanInfo for the given resource, based on the givenper-interface data.Return the basic MBeanInfo for resources of the given class andper-interface data.

There is one instance of this class forevery Standard MBean and every MXBean.  We try to limit the amountof information per instance so we can handle very large numbers ofMBeans comfortably.either Method or ConvertingMethod, for Standard MBeansand MXBeans respectively.We maintain a couple of caches to increase sharing betweendifferent MBeans of the same type and also to reduce creation timefor the second and subsequent instances of the same type.The first cache maps from an MBean interface to a PerInterfaceobject containing information parsed out of the interface.  Theinterface is either a Standard MBean interface or an MXBeaninterface, and there is one cache for each case.The PerInterface includes an MBeanInfo.  This contains theattributes and operations parsed out of the interface's methods,plus a basic Descriptor for the interface containing at least theinterfaceClassName field and any fields derived from annotations onthe interface.  This MBeanInfo can never be the MBeanInfo for anyactual MBean, because an MBeanInfo's getClassName() is the name ofa concrete class and we don't know what the class will be.Furthermore a real MBeanInfo may need to add constructors and/ornotifications to the MBeanInfo.The PerInterface also contains an MBeanDispatcher which is able toroute getAttribute, setAttribute, and invoke to the appropriatemethod of the interface, including doing any necessary translationof parameters and return values for MXBeans.The PerInterface also contains the original Class for the interface.We need to be careful about references.  When there are no MBeanswith a given interface, there must not be any strong references tothe interface Class.  Otherwise it could never be garbage collected,and neither could its ClassLoader or any other classes loaded byits ClassLoader.  Therefore the cache must wrap the PerInterfacein a WeakReference.  Each instance of MBeanSupport has a strongreference to its PerInterface, which prevents PerInterface instancesfrom being garbage-collected prematurely.The second cache maps from a concrete class and an MBean interfacethat that class implements to the MBeanInfo for that class andinterface.  (The ability to specify an interface separately comesfrom the class StandardMBean.  MBeans registered directly in theMBean Server will always have the same interface here.)The MBeanInfo in this second cache will be the MBeanInfo from thePerInterface cache for the given itnerface, but with thegetClassName() having the concrete class's name, and the publicconstructors based on the concrete class's constructors.  ThisMBeanInfo can be shared between all instances of the concrete classspecifying the same interface, except instances that areNotificationBroadcasters.  NotificationBroadcasters supply theMBeanNotificationInfo[] in the MBeanInfo based on the instancemethod NotificationBroadcaster.getNotificationInfo(), so twoinstances of the same concrete class do not necessarily have thesame MBeanNotificationInfo[].  Currently we do not try to detectwhen they do, although it would probably be worthwhile doing thatsince it is a very common case.Standard MBeans additionally have the property thatgetNotificationInfo() must in principle be called every timegetMBeanInfo() is called for the MBean, since the returned array isallowed to change over time.  We attempt to reduce the cost ofdoing this by detecting when the Standard MBean is a subclass ofNotificationBroadcasterSupport that does not overridegetNotificationInfo(), meaning that the MBeanNotificationInfo[] isthe one that was supplied to the constructor.  MXBeans do not havethis problem because their getNotificationInfo() method is calledonly once.Return the appropriate introspector for this type of MBean.Return a cookie for this MBean.  This cookie will be passed toMBean method invocations where it can supply additional informationto the invocation.  For example, with MXBeans it can be used tosupply the MXBeanLookup context for resolving inter-MXBean references. Methods that javax.management.StandardMBean should call from its preRegister and postRegister, given that it is not supposed to call the contained object's preRegister etc methods even if it has them Undo any work from registration.  We do this in postDeregister not preDeregister, because if the user preDeregister throws an exception then the MBean is not unregistered.

Consider an MXBean interface like this:public interface ModuleMXBean {ProductMXBean getProduct();void setProduct(ProductMXBean product);This defines an attribute called "Product" whose originalType willbe ProductMXBean and whose openType will be ObjectName.  Themapping happens as follows.When the MXBean's getProduct method is called, it is supposed toreturn a reference to another MXBean, or a proxy for anotherMXBean.  The MXBean layer has to convert this into an ObjectName.If it's a reference to another MXBean, it needs to be able to lookup the name under which that MXBean has been registered in thisMBeanServer; this is the purpose of the mxbeanToObjectName map.  Ifit's a proxy, it can check that the MBeanServer matches and if soextract the ObjectName from the proxy.When the setProduct method is called on a proxy for this MXBean,the argument can be either an MXBean reference (only really logicalif the proxy has a local MBeanServer) or another proxy.  So themapping logic is the same as for getProduct on the MXBean.When the MXBean's setProduct method is called, it needs to convertthe ObjectName into an object implementing the ProductMXBeaninterface.  We could have a lookup table that reversesmxbeanToObjectName, but this could violate the general JMX propertythat you cannot obtain a reference to an MBean object.  So wealways use a proxy for this.  However we do have anobjectNameToProxy map that allows us to reuse proxy instances.When the getProduct method is called on a proxy for this MXBean, itmust convert the returned ObjectName into an instance ofProductMXBean.  Again it can do this by making a proxy.From the above, it is clear that the logic for getX on an MXBean isthe same as for setX on a proxy, and vice versa. Message will be strange if mxbean is null but it is not supposed to be.removeReference can be called when the above condition fails,notably if you try to register the same MXBean twice./Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/jmx/mbeanserver/MXBeanMapping.javamakeOpenClassmakeOpenClass(java.lang.reflect.Type,javax.management.openmbean.OpenType)/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/target/classes/com/sun/jmx/mbeanserver/MXBeanMapping.classopenClass"Null argument"Null argumentClass<MXBeanMapping>Map<String,MXBeanMapping>Constructor<MXBeanMapping>Class<? super MXBeanMapping>TypeVariable<Class<MXBeanMapping>>TypeVariable<Class<MXBeanMapping>>[]Copyright (c) 2007, 2012, Oracle and/or its affiliates.

If so we invoke itand return the result.  This is for compatibilitywith code based on JMX RI 1.0 or 1.1 which allowed invoking gettersand setters.  It is *not* recommended that new code use this feature.Since this method is either going to throw an exception or usefunctionality that is strongly discouraged, we consider that itsperformance is not very important.A simpler way to implement the functionality would be to add the gettersand setters to the operations map when jmx.invoke.getters is set.However, that means that the property is consulted when an MBeaninterface is being introspected and not thereafter.  Previously,the property was consulted on every invocation.  So this simplerimplementation could potentially break code that sets and unsetsthe property at different times. Construct the exception that we will probably throw No compatibility requirement here Is the compatibility property set? We don't expect an exception here but if we get one then we'll simply assume that the property is not set.Visitor that sets up the method maps (operations, getters, setters)./Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/jmx/mbeanserver/Repository.javaretrieveNamedObjectretrieveNamedObject(javax.management.ObjectName)/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/target/classes/com/sun/jmx/mbeanserver/Repository.classMap<String,NamedObject>addMoiToTbaddMoiToTb(javax.management.DynamicMBean,javax.management.ObjectName,java.lang.String,java.util.Map,com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.Repository.RegistrationContext)unregisteringunregistering(com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.Repository.RegistrationContext,javax.management.ObjectName)registering(com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.Repository.RegistrationContext)addNewDomMoiaddNewDomMoi(javax.management.DynamicMBean,java.lang.String,javax.management.ObjectName,com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.Repository.RegistrationContext)addAllMatchingaddAllMatching(java.util.Map,java.util.Set,com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.Repository.ObjectNamePattern)nbElementsMap<String,Map<String,NamedObject>>domainTbObjectNamePatternObjectNamePattern(boolean,boolean,java.lang.String,java.util.Map,javax.management.ObjectName)/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_251.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/rt.jar/com/sun/jmx/mbeanserver/Repository$ObjectNamePattern.classisPropertyValuePatternisPropertyListPatternpatternHashtable<String,String>Dictionary<String,String>propertyListPatternpropertyValuePatterncanonicalPropskeyPropertyListsetValue(java.lang.String)p2Dictionary<String,String>()Hashtable<String,String>(java.util.Map)Hashtable<String,String>()Hashtable<String,String>(int)Hashtable<String,String>(int,float)moiTb? super NamedObject? extends NamedObjectBiFunction<? super NamedObject,? super NamedObject,? extends NamedObject>merge(java.lang.String,com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.NamedObject,java.util.function.BiFunction)BiFunction<? super String,? super NamedObject,? extends NamedObject>Function<? super String,? extends NamedObject>replace(java.lang.String,com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.NamedObject)replace(java.lang.String,com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.NamedObject,com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.NamedObject)putIfAbsent(java.lang.String,com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.NamedObject)BiConsumer<? super String,? super NamedObject>getOrDefault(java.lang.Object,com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.NamedObject)Entry<String,NamedObject>Set<Entry<String,NamedObject>>Collection<Entry<String,NamedObject>>Iterable<Entry<String,NamedObject>>Map<? extends String,? extends NamedObject>put(java.lang.String,com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.NamedObject)onadd(com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.NamedObject)Spliterator<NamedObject>Consumer<? super NamedObject>Iterator<NamedObject>Stream<NamedObject>BaseStream<NamedObject,Stream<NamedObject>>Predicate<? super NamedObject>Collection<? extends NamedObject>Iterable<? extends NamedObject>HashMap<String,NamedObject>AbstractMap<String,NamedObject>HashMap<String,NamedObject>()AbstractMap<String,NamedObject>()Node<String,NamedObject>TreeNode<String,NamedObject>newTreeNode(int,java.lang.String,com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.NamedObject,java.util.HashMap.Node)newNode(int,java.lang.String,com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.NamedObject,java.util.HashMap.Node)Node<String,NamedObject>[]putVal(int,java.lang.String,com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.NamedObject,boolean,boolean)HashMap<String,NamedObject>(java.util.Map)HashMap<String,NamedObject>(int)HashMap<String,NamedObject>(int,float)? super Map<String,NamedObject>? extends Map<String,NamedObject>BiFunction<? super Map<String,NamedObject>,? super Map<String,NamedObject>,? extends Map<String,NamedObject>>BiFunction<? super String,? super Map<String,NamedObject>,? extends Map<String,NamedObject>>Function<? super String,? extends Map<String,NamedObject>>BiConsumer<? super String,? super Map<String,NamedObject>>Entry<String,Map<String,NamedObject>>Set<Entry<String,Map<String,NamedObject>>>Collection<Entry<String,Map<String,NamedObject>>>Iterable<Entry<String,Map<String,NamedObject>>>Collection<Map<String,NamedObject>>Iterable<Map<String,NamedObject>>Map<? extends String,? extends Map<String,NamedObject>>"Unexpected exception while unregistering "Unexpected exception while unregistering HashMap<String,Map<String,NamedObject>>AbstractMap<String,Map<String,NamedObject>>HashMap<String,Map<String,NamedObject>>(int)AbstractMap<String,Map<String,NamedObject>>()Node<String,Map<String,NamedObject>>TreeNode<String,Map<String,NamedObject>>Node<String,Map<String,NamedObject>>[]HashMap<String,Map<String,NamedObject>>(java.util.Map)HashMap<String,Map<String,NamedObject>>()HashMap<String,Map<String,NamedObject>>(int,float)setValue(java.util.Map)to_default_domainClass<Repository>Map<String,Repository>Repository[]Constructor<Repository>? super RepositoryClass<? super Repository>TypeVariable<Class<Repository>>TypeVariable<Class<Repository>>[]"addMBean"addMBean"name = "name = "Repository: cannot add mbean for " +

If so, weretreat pat to just past that star and str to the positionafter the last one we tried, and we let the match advanceagain.Even though there is only one remembered star position, thealgorithm works when there are several stars in the pattern.When we encounter the second star, we forget the first one.This is OK, because if we get to the second star in A*B*C(where A etc are arbitrary strings), we have already seen AXB.We're therefore setting up a match of *C against the remainderof the string, which will match if that remainder looks likeYC, so the whole string looks like AXBYC.

Then, forevery ConnectorServer attached to a given MBeanServer, there is aninstance of the inner class ShareBuffer.  So for example with twoConnectorServers it looks like this:ConnectorServer1 -> ShareBuffer1 -\}-> ArrayNotificationBufferConnectorServer2 -> ShareBuffer2 -/              ||MBeanServerThe ArrayNotificationBuffer has a circular buffer ofNamedNotification objects.  Each ConnectorServer defines anotification buffer size, and this size is recorded by thecorresponding ShareBuffer.  The buffer size of theArrayNotificationBuffer is the maximum of all of its ShareBuffers.When a ShareBuffer is added or removed, the ArrayNotificationBuffersize is adjusted accordingly.An ArrayNotificationBuffer also has a BufferListener (which is aNotificationListener) registered on every NotificationBroadcasterMBean in the MBeanServer to which it is attached.  The cost of thispotentially large set of listeners is the principal motivation forsharing the ArrayNotificationBuffer between ConnectorServers, andalso the reason that we are careful to discard theArrayNotificationBuffer (and its BufferListeners) when there are nolonger any ConnectorServers using it.The synchronization of this class is inherently complex.  In an attemptto limit the complexity, we use just two locks:- globalLock controls access to the mapping between an MBeanServerand its ArrayNotificationBuffer and to the set of ShareBuffers foreach ArrayNotificationBuffer.- the instance lock of each ArrayNotificationBuffer controls accessto the array of notifications, including its size, and to thedispose flag of the ArrayNotificationBuffer.  The wait/notifymechanism is used to indicate changes to the array.If both locks are held at the same time, the globalLock must betaken first.Since adding or removing a BufferListener to an MBean can involvecalling user code, we are careful not to hold any locks while it isdone. FACTORY STUFF, INCLUDING SHARINGFind out queue sizeWe avoid holding any locks while calling createListeners.This prevents possible deadlocks involving user code, butdoes mean that a second ConnectorServer created and startedin this window will return before all the listeners are ready,which could lead to surprising behaviour.  The alternativewould be to block the second ConnectorServer until the firstone has finished adding all the listeners, but that would thenbe subject to deadlock.Ensure that this buffer is no longer the one that will be returned bygetNotificationBuffer.

In that case the addition will overflow and producea negative end time.  Set end time to Long.MAX_VALUE in thatcase.  We assume System.currentTimeMillis() is positive. overflowWe set earliestSeq the first time through the loop.  If weset it here, notifications could be dropped before westarted examining them, so earliestSeq might not correspondto the earliest notification we examined.On exit from this loop, notifs, earliestSeq, and nextSeq mustall be correct values for the returned NotificationResult.Get the next available notification regardless of filters,or wait for one to arrive if there is none.First time through.  The current earliestSequenceNumberis the first one we could have examined.If many notifications have been dropped since thelast time through, nextSeq could now be earlierthan the current earliest.  If so, notificationsmay have been lost and we return now so the callercan see this next time it calls. Skip security check if NotificationBufferFilter is not overloadednextSeq is the largest sequence number.  If wealready got notifications, return them now.Otherwise wait for some to arrive, withtimeout.dispose calledWe have a candidate notification.  See if it matchesour filters.  We do this outside the synchronized blockso we don't hold up everyone accessing the buffer(including notification senders) while we evaluatepotentially slow filters.We only check the max size now, so that ourreturned nextSeq is as large as possible.  Thisprevents the caller from thinking it missedinteresting notifications when in fact we knew theyweren't. end whileConstruct and return the result.Add our listener to every NotificationBroadcaster MBeancurrently in the MBean server and to everyNotificationBroadcaster later created.It would be really nice if we could just dombs.addNotificationListener(new ObjectName("*:*"), ...);Definitely something for the next version of JMX.There is a nasty race condition that we must handle.  Wefirst register for MBean-creation notifications so we can addlisteners to new MBeans, then we query the existing MBeans toadd listeners to them.  The problem is that a new MBean couldarrive after we register for creations but before the query hascompleted.  Then we could see the MBean both in the query andin an MBean-creation notification, and we would end upregistering our listener twice.To solve this problem, we arrange for new MBeans that arrivewhile the query is being done to be added to the Set createdDuringQueryand we do not add a listener immediately.  When the query is done,we atomically turn off the addition of new names to createdDuringQueryand add all the names that were there to the result of the query.Since we are dealing with Sets, the result is the same whether or notthe newly-created MBean was included in the query result.It is important not to hold any locks during the operation of addinglisteners to MBeans.  An MBean's addNotificationListener can bearbitrary user code, and this could deadlock with any locks we hold(see bug 6239400).  The corollary is that we must not do any operationsin this method or the methods it calls that require locks.Spec doesn't say whether Set returned by QueryNames can be modifiedso we clone it.This can happen if the MBean was unregistered justafter the query.  Or user NotificationBroadcaster mightthrow unexpected exception.This method must not be synchronized.  See the comment on thecreateListeners method.The notification could arrive after our buffer has been destroyedor even during its destruction.  So we always add our listener(without synchronization), then we check if the buffer has beendestroyed and if so remove the listener we just added.Iterate until we extract the real exceptionfrom a stack of PrivilegedActionExceptions./Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/jmx/remote/internal/ArrayQueue.javanewArraynewArray(int)AbstractList<T>AbstractCollection<T>Collection<T>Iterable<T>List<T>newcapacitynewqueue"Resizing would lose data"Resizing would lose datanewtail"Queue full"Queue fullremoved"Can only remove head of queue"Can only remove head of queue"Queue empty"Queue empty"Index "Index ", queue size ", queue size  we did add something Can't use % here because it's not mod: -3 % 2 is -1, not +1./Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/jmx/remote/internal/ClientCommunicatorAdmin.java/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/target/classes/com/sun/jmx/remote/internal/ClientCommunicatorAdmin.classTERMINATEDFAILEDRE_CONNECTINGCONNECTEDperiodcheckerrestartrestart(java.io.IOException)threadNo"ClientCommunicatorAdmin"ClientCommunicatorAdmin"JMX client heartbeat "JMX client heartbeat "The client has been closed."The client has been closed.ire"restart""Failed to restart: "Failed to restart: eeemyThread/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_251.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/rt.jar/com/sun/jmx/remote/internal/ClientCommunicatorAdmin$Checker.classstop()CheckerChecker()"Checker-run"Checker-run"Failed to check connection: "Failed to check connection: "stopping"stopping"Failed to check the connection: "Failed to check the connection: "Finished."Finished.Called by a client to inform of getting an IOException.Called by this class to check a client connection.Tells a client to re-start again.Tells a client to stop because failing to call checkConnection.Terminates this object. check state already failed to re-start by another thread restart process has been called by another thread we need to wait be asked to give up restarted is failed by another thread re-starting OK.

All rights reserved.An Executor that allows at most one executing and one pendingRunnable.  It uses at most one thread -- as soon as there isno pending Runnable the thread can exit.  Another thread iscreated as soon as there is a new pending Runnable.  ThisExecutor is adapted for use in a situation where each Runnableusually schedules up another Runnable.  On return from thefirst one, the second one is immediately executed.  So thisjust becomes a complicated way to write a while loop, but withthe advantage that you can replace it with another Executor,for instance one that you are using to execute a bunch of otherunrelated work.You might expect that a java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutorwith corePoolSize=0 and maximumPoolSize=1 would have the samebehavior, but it does not.  A ThreadPoolExecutor only createsa new thread when a new task is submitted and the number ofexisting threads is < corePoolSize.  This can never happen whencorePoolSize=0, so new threads are never created.  Surprising,but there you are.You can supply an Executor in which the remote call tofetchNotifications will be made.  The Executor's executemethod reschedules another task, so you must not usean Executor that executes tasks in the caller's thread.Called to to fetch notifications from a server.Used to send out a notification about lost notifsCalled when a connector is doing reconnection. Like <code>postReconnection</code>,this method is intended to be called only by a client connector:<code>RMIConnector</code> and <code>ClientIntermediary</code>.Call this method will set the flag beingReconnection to <code>true</code>,and the thread used to fetch notifis will be stopped, a new thread can becreated only after the method <code>postReconnection</code> is called.It is caller's responsiblity to not re-call this method before calling<code>postReconnection</code>. should neverCalled after reconnection is finished.This method is intended to be called only by a client connector: doing or waiting reconnection only update mbeanRemovedNotifID old listeners are re-added not update clientSequenceNumber only new listeners added during reconnection need update clientSequenceNumber ------------------------------------------------- private classes Log only once. Set new context class loader, returns previous one. if ctxt is null, log a config message and throw a SecurityException. get context class loader - may throw SecurityException - though unlikely. if nothing needs to be done, break here... reset context class loader - may throw SecurityException nr == null means got exception check sequence number. check if an mbean unregistration notif forward tell that the thread is REALLY stopped no more fetchingFetch one notification when we suspect that it might be anotification that we can't deserialize (because of amissing class).  First we ask for 0 notifications with 0timeout.  This allows us to skip sequence numbers fornotifications that don't match our filters.  Then we askfor one notification.  If that produces aClassNotFoundException, NotSerializableException orUnmarshalException, we increase our sequence number and ask again.Eventually we will either get a successful notification, or areturn with 0 notifications.  In either case we can return aNotificationResult.  This algorithm works (albeit lesswell) even if the server implementation doesn't optimize arequest for 0 notifications to skip sequence numbers fornotifications that don't match our filters.If we had at least oneClassNotFoundException/NotSerializableException/UnmarshalException,then we must emit a JMXConnectionNotification.LOST_NOTIFS. 0 notifs to update startSequenceNumber 1 notif to skip possible missing class Even if result.getEarliestSequenceNumber() is now greater than it was initially, meaning some notifs have been dropped from the buffer, we don't want the caller to see that because it is then likely to renotify about the lost notifs. So we put back the first value of earliestSequenceNumber that we saw. no more listener, stop fetching private methodsCalled to decide whether need to start a thread for fetching notifs.<P>The parameter reconnected will decide whether to initilize the clientSequenceNumber,initilaizing the clientSequenceNumber means to ignore all notifications arrived before.If it is reconnected, we will not initialize in order to get all notifications arrivedduring the reconnection. It may cause the newly registered listeners to receive somenotifications arrived before its registray. wait for another thread to do, which is doing reconnection make sure only one fetching thread. re-call this method to check the state again, the state can be other value like TERMINATED. init the clientSequenceNumber if not reconnected.

Finally, we applysome access checks which may also reject the listener.A given notification may trigger several listeners on the same MBean,which is why listenerMap is a Map<ObjectName, Set<IdAndFilter>> andwhy we add the found notifications to a supplied List rather thanjust returning a boolean. We proceed in two stages here, to avoid holding the listenerMap lock while invoking the filters (which are user code). We don't synchronize on targetedNotifs, because it is a local variable of our caller and no other thread can see it. The standard RMI connector client will register a listener on the MBeanServerDelegate in order to be told when MBeans are unregistered.  We snoop on fetched notifications so that we can know too, and remove the corresponding entry from the listenerMap. See 6957378. This is a notification from the MBeanServerDelegate.

We're not giving any information to the bad guys, other than that the access control is based on a file, which they could have worked out from the stack trace anyway. We studiously avoided regexes when parsing the properties file, because that is done whenever the VM is started with the appropriate -Dcom.sun.management options, even if nobody ever creates an MBean.  We don't want to incur the overhead of loading all the regex code whenever those options are specified, but if we get as far as here then the VM is already running and somebody is doing the very unusual operation of remotely creating an MBean. Because that operation is so unusual, we don't try to optimize by hand-matching or by caching compiled Pattern objects. pseudo-codepoint "end of string" just for better error messages the string we're parsing s.length() At any point, either c is s.codePointAt(i), or i == len and c is EOS.  We use int rather than char because it is conceivable (if unlikely) that a classname in a create clause might contain "supplementary characters", the ones that don't fit in the original 16 bits for Unicode. We don't check that classname components begin with suitable characters (so we accept 1.2.3 for example).  This means that there are only two states, which we can call dotOK and !dotOK according as a dot (.) is legal or not.  Initially we're in !dotOK since a classname can't start with a dot; after a dot we're in !dotOK again; and after any other characters we're in dotOK.  The classname is only accepted if we end in dotOK, so we reject an empty name or a name that ends with a dot. Advance c and i to the next character, unless already at EOS./Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/jmx/remote/security/NotificationAccessController.java<p>This interface allows to control remote access to the{@code addNotificationListener} and {@code removeNotificationListener}methods when the notification listener parameter is of type{@code NotificationListener} and also allows to control remote accessto the notifications being forwarded to the interested remote listeners.</p><p>An implementation of this interface can be supplied to a{@code JMXConnectorServer} in the environment map through the{@code com.sun.jmx.remote.notification.access.controller}environment map property.</p>This method is called when a remote{@link javax.management.remote.JMXConnector} invokes the method{@link javax.management.MBeanServerConnection#addNotificationListener(ObjectName,NotificationListener,NotificationFilter,Object)}.the {@code connectionId} of the remote clientadding the listener.the name of the MBean where the listener is to be added.the authenticated subject representing the remote client.if the remote client with the suppliedauthenticated subject does not have the rights to add a listenerto the supplied MBean.{@link javax.management.MBeanServerConnection#removeNotificationListener(ObjectName,NotificationListener)}or the method{@link javax.management.MBeanServerConnection#removeNotificationListener(ObjectName,NotificationListener,NotificationFilter,Object)}.removing the listener.the name of the MBean where the listener is to be removed.authenticated subject does not have the rights to remove a listenerfrom the supplied MBean.This method is called before the{@link javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorServer}forwards the notification to the interested remotelistener represented by the authenticated subject.receiving the notification.the name of the MBean forwarding the notification.the notification to be forwarded to the interestedremote listener.if the remote client withthe supplied authenticated subject does not have therights to receive the notification./Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/jmx/remote/security/SubjectDelegator.javagetSubjectPrincipalsgetSubjectPrincipals(javax.security.auth.Subject)/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/target/classes/com/sun/jmx/remote/security/SubjectDelegator.classgetDelegatedAccgetDelegatedAcc(javax.security.auth.Subject,boolean)authenticatedACCdelegatedSubjectremoveCallerContextCollection<Permission>Iterable<Permission>ArrayList<Permission>AbstractList<Permission>AbstractCollection<Permission>List<Permission>ArrayList<Permission>(int)Spliterator<Permission>? super PermissionConsumer<? super Permission>Iterator<Permission>Stream<Permission>BaseStream<Permission,Stream<Permission>>Predicate<? super Permission>? extends PermissionCollection<? extends Permission>Iterable<? extends Permission>add(java.security.Permission)AbstractCollection<Permission>()ListIterator<Permission>add(int,java.security.Permission)set(int,java.security.Permission)Comparator<? super Permission>UnaryOperator<Permission>Function<Permission,Permission>AbstractList<Permission>()ArrayList<Permission>(java.util.Collection)ArrayList<Permission>()/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/target/classes/com/sun/jmx/remote/security/SubjectDelegator$1.classsdp"Illegal AccessControlContext: null"Illegal AccessControlContext: nullpnameClass<? extends Principal>Map<String,? extends Principal>? extends Principal[]Constructor<? extends Principal>? super ? extends PrincipalClass<? super ? extends Principal>TypeVariable<Class<? extends Principal>>TypeVariable<Class<? extends Principal>>[]List<Principal>Copyright (c) 2003, 2014, Oracle and/or its affiliates.

ParseException.java Version 0.7pre6This exception is thrown when parse errors are encountered.You can explicitly create objects of this exception type bycalling the method generateParseException in the generatedparser.You can modify this class to customize your error reportingmechanisms so long as you retain the public fields.This constructor is used by the method "generateParseException"in the generated parser.  Calling this constructor generatesa new object of this type with the fields "currentToken","expectedTokenSequences", and "tokenImage" set.  The booleanflag "specialConstructor" is also set to true to indicate thatthis constructor was used to create this object.This constructor calls its super class with the empty stringto force the "toString" method of parent class "Throwable" toprint the error message in the form:ParseException: <result of getMessage>The following constructors are for use by you for whateverpurpose you can think of.  Constructing the exception in thismanner makes the exception behave in the normal way - i.e., asdocumented in the class "Throwable".  The fields "errorToken","expectedTokenSequences", and "tokenImage" do not containrelevant information.  The JavaCC generated code does not usethese constructors.This variable determines which constructor was used to createthis object and thereby affects the semantics of the"getMessage" method (see below).This is the last token that has been consumed successfully.  Ifthis object has been created due to a parse error, the tokenfollowng this token will (therefore) be the first error token.Each entry in this array is an array of integers.  Each arrayof integers represents a sequence of tokens (by their ordinalvalues) that is expected at this point of the parse.This is a reference to the "tokenImage" array of the generatedparser within which the parse error occurred.  This array isdefined in the generated ...Constants interface.This method has the standard behavior when this object has beencreated using the standard constructors.  Otherwise, it uses"currentToken" and "expectedTokenSequences" to generate a parseerror message and returns it.  If this object has been createddue to a parse error, and you do not catch it (it gets thrownfrom the parser), then this method is called during the printingof the final stack trace, and hence the correct error messagegets displayed.The end of line string for this machine.Used to convert raw characters to their escaped versionwhen these raw version cannot be used as part of an ASCIIstring literal./Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/jmx/snmp/IPAcl/Parser.javajj_savejj_save(int,int)/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/target/classes/com/sun/jmx/snmp/IPAcl/Parser.classjj_rescan_tokenjj_rescan_token()jj_add_error_tokenjj_add_error_token(int,int)jj_endposjj_lasttokensjj_kindjj_expentryVector<int[]>AbstractList<int[]>AbstractCollection<int[]>Collection<int[]>Iterable<int[]>List<int[]>jj_expentriesjj_ntkjj_ntk()jj_scan_tokenjj_scan_token(int)jj_consume_tokenjj_consume_token(int)jj_gcjj_rescanJJCalls[]jj_2_rtnsjj_la1_1jj_la1_0jj_la1jj_genjj_semLAjj_lajj_lastposjj_scanposjj_input_streamjj_3R_14jj_3R_14()jj_3_1jj_3_1()jj_3_2jj_3_2()jj_3_3jj_3_3()jj_2_3jj_2_3(int)jj_2_2jj_2_2(int)jj_2_1jj_2_1(int)0x800005242880x10000010485760x200081920x600003932160x110000002852126720x91000000-18622709760x8000Vector<int[]>()Spliterator<int[]>? super int[]Consumer<? super int[]>Iterator<int[]>Stream<int[]>BaseStream<int[],Stream<int[]>>Predicate<? super int[]>? extends int[]Collection<? extends int[]>Iterable<? extends int[]>add(int[])AbstractCollection<int[]>()ListIterator<int[]>add(int,int[])set(int,int[])Comparator<? super int[]>UnaryOperator<int[]>Function<int[],int[]>AbstractList<int[]>()addElement(int[])insertElementAt(int[],int)setElementAt(int[],int)Enumeration<int[]>Vector<int[]>(java.util.Collection)Vector<int[]>(int)Vector<int[]>(int,int)jjtn000jjtc000jjte000"Missing return statement in function"Missing return statement in functionlabel_1label_2label_3label_4label_5label_6label_7label_8label_9label_10label_11label_12label_13xlaxspoldTokenenumvoldentryla1tokensexptokseq/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_251.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/rt.jar/com/sun/jmx/snmp/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_251.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/rt.jar/com/sun/jmx/snmp/IPAcl/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_251.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/rt.jar/com/sun/jmx/snmp/IPAcl/Parser$JJCalls.classgenJJCallsJJCalls()Generated By:JJTree&JavaCC: Do not edit this line.

The context is a set of mappings between Stringsand Objects.  It is managed as a stack, typically with code likethis:</p>ThreadContext oldContext = ThreadContext.push(myKey, myObject);// plus possibly further calls to ThreadContext.push...doSomeOperation();} finally {ThreadContext.restore(oldContext);<p>The <code>try</code>...<code>finally</code> block ensures thatthe <code>restore</code> is done even if<code>doSomeOperation</code> terminates abnormally (with anexception).</p><p>A thread can consult its own context using<code>ThreadContext.get(myKey)</code>.  The result is thevalue that was most recently pushed with the given key.</p><p>A thread cannot read or modify the context of another thread.</p>The context of a thread is stored as a linked list.  At thehead of the list is the value returned by localContext.get().At the tail of the list is a sentinel ThreadContext value with"previous" and "key" both null.  There is a different sentinelobject for each thread.Because a null key indicates the sentinel, we reject attempts topush context entries with a null key.The reason for using a sentinel rather than just terminatingthe list with a null reference is to protect against incorrector even malicious code.  If you have a reference to thesentinel value, you can erase the context stack.  Only thecaller of the first "push" that put something on the stack canget such a reference, so if that caller does not give thisreference away, no one else can erase the stack.If the restore method took a null reference to mean an emptystack, anyone could erase the stack, since anyone can make anull reference.When the stack is empty, we discard the sentinel object andhave localContext.get() return null.  Then we recreate thesentinel object on the first subsequent push.ThreadContext objects are immutable.  As a consequence, you cangive a ThreadContext object to setInitialContext that is nolonger current.  But the interface says this can be rejected,in case we remove immutability later.We have to comment out "final" here because of a bug in the JDK1.1compiler.  Uncomment it when we discard 1.1 compatibility.<p>Get the Object that was most recently pushed with the given key.</p>the key of interest.the last Object that was pushed (using<code>push</code>) with that key and not subsequently canceledby a <code>restore</code>; or null if there is no such object.A null return value may also indicate that the last Objectpushed was the value <code>null</code>.

But if someonedidn't notice that during subsequent changes, they couldaccidentally permit restore(null) with the semantics oftrashing the context stack.Check that the restored context is in the stack.Discard the sentinel if the stack is empty.  This means that itis an error to call "restore" a second time with theThreadContext value that means an empty stack.  That's why wedon't say that it is all right to restore the stack to thestate it was already in.<p>Set the initial context of the calling thread to a context obtainedfrom another thread.  After this call, the calling thread will seethe same results from the <code>get</code> method as the threadfrom which the <code>context</code> argument was obtained, at thetime it was obtained.</p><p>The <code>context</code> argument must be the result of an earlier<code>push</code> or <code>getThreadContext</code> call.

An implementation may also throw thisexception if <code>context</code> is no longer current in thethread from which it was obtained.We rely on the fact that ThreadContext objects are immutable.This means that we don't have to check that the "context"argument is valid.  It necessarily represents the head of avalid chain of ThreadContext objects, even if the thread fromwhich it was obtained has subsequently been set to a pointlater in that chain using "restore".The following test assumes that we discard sentinels when thestack is empty./Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/jmx/snmp/Timestamp.javauptimeCache/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/target/classes/com/sun/jmx/snmp/Timestamp.classcrtimesysUpTime242456119149401823L242456119149401823uptimewhen"{SysUpTime = "{SysUpTime = "} {Timestamp = "} {Timestamp = This class is used by the {@link com.sun.jmx.snmp.SnmpVarBindList SnmpVarBindList} object.An <CODE>SnmpVarBindList</CODE> time stamp object represents the time stamp when the list was updatedwith the response variables.The time (in hundreds of a second) since the network management portion of the systemwas last re-initialized.A <CODE>long</CODE> representing the current date.The <CODE>SnmpTimeticks</CODE> object corresponding to the <CODE>TimeStamp</CODE> object.The default constructor. <CODE>Sysuptime</CODE> is 0.This simply indicates when this object was created.Creates a <CODE>TimeStamp</CODE> object using the user parameters.The time (in hundredths of a second) since thenetwork management portion of the system was last re-initialized.The current time.Gets the <CODE>SnmpTimeticks</CODE> object corresponding to the <CODE>TimeStamp</CODE> object.The <CODE>SnmpTimeticks</CODE> object.Gets the time (in hundredths of a second) since the network management portion of the systemThe <CODE>sysUpTime</CODE>.Gets the current date.A <CODE>Date</CODE> object representing the current date.Returns a <CODE>String</CODE> representation of the <CODE>TimeStamp</CODE> object.A <CODE>String</CODE> representation of the <CODE>TimeStamp</CODE> object./Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/jmx/snmp/UserAcl.javacontextNamesecurityLevelDefines the user based ACL used by the SNMP protocol adaptor.Checks whether or not the specified user has <CODE>READ</CODE> access.The user name to check.Checks whether or not the specified user and context name have <CODE>READ</CODE> access.The context name associated with the user.The request security level.<CODE>true</CODE> if the pair (user, context) has read permission, <CODE>false</CODE> otherwise.Checks whether or not a context name is defined.The context name to check.<CODE>true</CODE> if the context is known, <CODE>false</CODE> otherwise.Checks whether or not the specified user has <CODE>WRITE</CODE> access.The user to check.<CODE>true</CODE> if the user has write permission, <CODE>false</CODE> otherwise.Checks whether or not the specified user and context name have <CODE>WRITE</CODE> access.<CODE>true</CODE> if the pair (user, context) has write permission, <CODE>false</CODE> otherwise./Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/jmx/snmp/agent/AcmChecker.java/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/jmx/snmp/agentcom.sun.jmx.snmp.agentSNMP_ADAPTOR_LOGGERcheckCurrentOidcheckCurrentOid()/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/target/classes/com/sun/jmx/snmp/agent/AcmChecker.class/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/target/classes/com/sun/jmx/snmp/agentremove(int,int)add(int,long[],int,int)add(int,long)AcmCheckerAcmChecker(com.sun.jmx.snmp.agent.SnmpMibRequest)securityModelpduTypeClass<SnmpMib>Map<String,SnmpMib>SnmpMib[]Constructor<SnmpMib>? super SnmpMibClass<? super SnmpMib>TypeVariable<Class<SnmpMib>>TypeVariable<Class<SnmpMib>>[]"AcmChecker(SnmpMibRequest)"AcmChecker(SnmpMibRequest)"SNMP V3 Access Control to be done"SNMP V3 Access Control to be done"Will check oid for : principal : "Will check oid for : principal : "; securityLevel : "; securityLevel : "; pduType : "; pduType : "; version : "; version : "; securityModel : "; securityModel : "; contextName : "; contextName : "Unknown Model, no ACM check."Unknown Model, no ACM check."checkCurrentOid""Checking access for : "Checking access for : Oid Checker makes use of ACM to check each OID during the getnext process.We are in V3 architecture, ACM is in the picture./Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/src/main/java/com/sun/jmx/snmp/agent/LongList.javaallocateallocate(int)/Users/jettt/IdeaProjects/jdk_test/target/classes/com/sun/jmx/snmp/agent/LongList.classensure(int)LongListLongList(int,int)LongList(int)LongList()DELTAoldsizenewlistThis list is used in order to construct the OID during the getnext.The constructed oid is checked by the checker AcmChecker.The list content.

The subnodes are registered at run timewhen registering the nested groups in the global MIB OID tree. We will register the OID arcs leading to subgroups in this hashtable.

This implementation can be changed if needed... For instance, the subclass could provide a generated isNestedArc() method in which the subgroup OID arcs would be hardcoded. However, the generic approach was preferred because at this time groups and subgroups are dynamically registered in the MIB.Tell whether the given OID arc identifies a sub-treeleading to a nested SNMP sub-group. This method is used internally.You shouldn't need to call it directly.<CODE>true</CODE> if the given OID arc identifies a subtreeleading to a nested SNMP sub-group. if the arc is registered in the hashtable, it leads to a subgroup. If we reach this node, we are below the root OID, so we just return. This method can also be overriden in a subclass to provide a different implementation of the isNestedArc() method. => if isNestedArc() is hardcoded, then registerSubArc() becomes    useless and can become empty.Register an OID arc that identifies a sub-treeYou shouldn't ever call it directly. registers the arc in the hashtable. The SnmpMibOid algorithm relies on the fact that for every arc registered in varList, there is a corresponding node at the same position in children. So the trick is to register a null node in children for each variable in varList, so that the real subgroup nodes can be inserted at the correct location. registerObject() should be called for each scalar object and each table arc by the generated subclass.Register an OID arc that identifies a scalar object or a table.This method is used internally. You shouldn't ever call it directly. this will register the variable in both varList and children The node registered in children will be null, so that the parent algorithm will behave as if no node were registered. This is a trick that makes the parent algorithm behave as if only subgroups were registered in varList and children. registerNode() will be called at runtime when nested groups are registered in the MIB. So we do know that this method will only be called to register nested-groups. We trap registerNode() in order to call registerSubArc()Register a child node of this node in the OID tree.The oid of the node being registered.The position reached in the oid.The node being registered. if we get here, then it means we are registering a subgroup. We will thus register the sub arc in the subgroups hashtable. see comments in SnmpMibNode Nothing is left... the oid is not valid This arc leads to a subgroup: delegates the search to the method defined in SnmpMibOid This arc leads to a table: forward the search to the table. Gets the table Forward the search to the table If it's not a variable, throws an exception The trailing .0 is missing in the OID There are too many arcs left in the OID (there should remain a single trailing .0) The last trailing arc is not .0 It's one of our variable, register this node. See comments in SnmpMibNode. This should be considered as a genErr, but we do not want to abort the whole request, so we're going to throw a noSuchObject... The generic case where the end of the OID has been reached is handled in the superclass XXX Revisit: this works but it is somewhat convoluted. Just setting              arc to -1 would work too. Ok, we've got the arc. We have a recursive logic. Should we have a loop instead? If the arc identifies a table, then we need to forward the search to the table.

We know that the entry does not exists if (isentry == false). we're not doing a set we're doing a set but creation is disabled. Validate the entry id The entry already exists - validate the id Registers this node for the identified entry. We only try to identify the RowStatus for SET operations Implements the method defined in SnmpMibNode. The algorithm is very largely inspired from the original getNext() method. If the querried oid contains less arcs than the OID of the xxxEntry object, we must return the first leaf under the first columnar object: the best way to do that is to reset the queried oid:   oid[0] = nodeId (arc of the xxxEntry object)   pos    = 0 (points to the arc of the xxxEntry object) then we just have to proceed... this will have the side effect to set    oid[pos] = nodeId and    (pos+1) = length so we won't fall into the "else if" cases below - so using "else if" rather than "if ..." is guaranteed to be safe. oid[pos] is expected to be the id of the xxxEntry ... The id requested is greater than the id of the xxxEntry, so we won't find the next element in this table... (any element in this table will have a smaller OID) we must return the first leaf under the first columnar object, so we are back to our first case where pos was out of bounds... => reset the oid to contain only the arc of the xxxEntry object. The arc at the position "pos+1" is the id of the columnar object (ie: the id of the variable in the table entry) Now that we've got everything right we can begin. pos points to the last arc in the oid, and this arc is guaranteed to be the xxxEntry id (we have handled all the other possibilities before) We must therefore return the first leaf below the first columnar object in the table. Get the first index. If an exception is raised, then it means that the table is empty. We thus do not have to catch the exception - we let it propagate to the caller. In that case we have (pos+1) = (length-1), so pos points to the arc of the querried variable (columnar object). Since the requested oid stops there, it means we have to return the first leaf under this columnar object. So we first get the first index: Note: if this raises an exception, this means that the table is empty, so we can let the exception propagate to the caller. XXX revisit: not exactly perfect:     a specific row could be empty.. But we don't know     how to make the difference! => tradeoff holes     in tables can't be properly supported (all rows     must have the same holes) So now there remain one last case, namely: some part of the index is provided by the oid... We build a possibly incomplete and invalid index from the OID. The piece of index provided should begin at pos+2   oid[pos]   = id of the xxxEntry object,   oid[pos+1] = id of the columnar object,   oid[pos+2] ... oid[length-1] = piece of index. We get the next index following the provided index. If this raises an exception, then it means that we have reached the last index in the table, and we must then try with the next columnar object. Bug fix 4269251 The SnmpIndex is defined to contain a valid oid: this is not an SNMP requirement for the getNext request. So we no more use the SnmpIndex but directly the SnmpOid. If the variable must ne skipped, fall through... Loop on each var (column) This should not happen. If it happens, (bug, or customized methods returning garbage instead of raising an exception), it probably means that there is nothing to return anyway. So we throw the exception. => will skip to next node in the MIB tree. So here we know both the row (entryoid) and the column (var) Raising an exception here will make the catch() clause switch to the next variable. If `var' is not readable for this specific entry, it is not readable for any other entry => skip to next column. Prepare the result and the ACM checker. Bug detector! Copy the entryOid at the end of `result' Set the node Id and var Id in result. Append nodeId.varId.<rowOid> to ACM checker. No we're going to ACM check our OID. No exception thrown by checker => this is all OK! we have it: register the handler and return the result. Skip to the next entry. If an exception is thrown, will be catch by enclosing catch and a skip is done to the next var. Clean the checker. Catching an exception here means we have to skip to the next column.

Constructor: @param  req The SnmpMibRequest that will be segmented in this         tree. It holds the original varbind vector passed         by the SnmpSubRequestHandler to this MIB. This         varbind vector is used to retrieve the "real"         position of a varbind in the vector. There is no other easy         way to do this - since as a result of the segmentation the         original positions will be lost. @param  creationflag indicates whether the operation involved         allows for entry creation (ie: it is a SET request). @param  pdutype indicates the type of the request PDU as defined         in SnmpDefinitions Now take care of V2 errorCodes that can be stored in the varbind itself: noSuchObject => notWritable noSuchInstance => notWritable noSuchObject => noSuchObject noSuchInstance => noSuchInstance Now we're going to try to transform every other global code in either noSuchInstance or noSuchObject, so that the get can return a partial result. Only noSuchInstance or noSuchObject can be stored in the varbind itself. According to RFC 1905: noAccess is emitted when the the access is denied because it is not in the MIB view... noAccess => noSuchInstance According to RFC 1905: (my interpretation because it is not really clear) The specified variable name exists - but the variable does not exists and cannot be created under the present circumstances (probably because the request specifies another variable/value which is incompatible, or because the value of some other variable in the MIB prevents the creation) Note that this error should never be raised in a GET context but who knows? inconsistentName => noSuchInstance All the errors comprised between snmpRspWrongType and snmpRspInconsistentValue concern values: so we're going to assume the OID was correct, and reply with noSuchInstance. We're going to assume the OID was correct, and reply with noSuchInstance. For all other errors but genErr, we're going to reply with noSuchObject Only genErr will abort the GET and be returned as global------------------------------------------------------------------- This class is a package implementation of the enumeration of SnmSubRequest associated with an Handler node. This class is a package implementation of the SnmpMibSubRequest interface. It can only be instantiated by SnmpRequestTree. ------------------------------------------------------------- XXX not sure we must also add the varbind in the global     request? or whether we should raise an exception:     in principle, this method should not be called! Implements the method defined in SnmpMibSubRequest interface. See SnmpMibSubRequest for the java doc. The index in the exception must correspond to the SNMP index ... If we're doing a getnext ==> endOfMibView Although the first pass of check() did not fail, the set() phase could not be carried out correctly. Since we don't know how to make an "undo", and some assignation may already have been performed, we're going to throw an snmpRspUndoFailed. We throw the exception in order to abort the SET operation in an atomic way. This class implements a node in the SnmpRequestTree. It stores:    o The SnmpMibNode involved (key)    o The sublist of varbind directly handled by this node    o A vector of sublists concerning the entries (existing or not)      of the SnmpMIbNode (when it is a table).

Tells whether creation of new entries is allowed with respect to the operation involved (GET=>false/SET=>true) Tells whether we are currently processing a SET request (check/set) Returns the protocol version in which the original request is evaluated. Returns the actual protocol version of the request PDU. Returns the SnmpMibNode associated with the given handler Indicates the depth of the arc in the OID that identifies the SnmpMibNode associated with the given handler returns an enumeration of the SnmpMibSubRequest's to be invoked on the SnmpMibNode associated with a given Handler node. If this node is a group, there will be a single subrequest. If it is a table, there will be one subrequest per entry involved. returns an enumeration of the Handlers stored in the Hashtable. adds a varbind to a handler node sublist adds an entry varbind to a handler node sublist adds an entry varbind to a handler node sublist - specifying the varbind which holds the row status Protected interface Type of the request (see SnmpDefinitions) We deal with a GET-NEXT request Tell whether creation is allowed. Returns the subrequest handled by the SnmpMibNode itself (in principle, only for Groups) Returns the subrequest associated with the entry identified by the given entry (only for tables) the given entry (only for tables). The `entry' parameter is an index relative to the position of the entry in the handler sublist. Private section stores a handler node in the Hashtable finds a handler node in the Hashtable Search for the given oid in `oids'. If none is found, returns -1 otherwise, returns the index at which the oid is located. Return the index at which the given oid should be inserted in the `oids' array. In the calling method we will have to check for this case...    if (comp == 0)       return -1; Returning curr instead of -1 avoids having to call findOid() first and getInsertionPoint() afterwards. We can simply call getInsertionPoint() and then checks whether there's an OID at the returned position which equals the given OID. adds a varbind in a handler node sublist retrieve the handler node associated with the given meta, If no handler node was found for that meta, create one.    debug("registerNode", "adding node for " +          varbind.oid.toString()); else {   if (isDebugOn())      debug("registerNode","found node for " +            varbind.oid.toString()); Adds the varbind in the handler node's sublist.

The ClientHandler will remove themselves from the clientHandlerVector at the end of their run() method, by calling notifyClientHandlerDeleted(). Since the clientHandlerVector is modified by the ClientHandler threads we must avoid using Enumeration or Iterator to loop over this array. We must also take care of NoSuchElementException which could be thrown if the last ClientHandler removes itself between the call to clientHandlerVector.isEmpty() and the call to clientHandlerVector.firstElement(). What we *MUST NOT DO* is locking the clientHandlerVector, because this would most probably cause a deadlock.Call <CODE>interrupt()</CODE> on each pending client. over this array. We cannot use the same logic here than in waitClientTermination() because there is no guarantee that calling interrupt() on the ClientHandler will actually terminate the ClientHandler. Since we do not want to wait for the actual ClientHandler termination, we cannot simply loop over the array until it is empty (this might result in calling interrupt() endlessly on the same client handler. So what we do is simply take a snapshot copy of the vector and loop over the copy.Controls the way the CommunicatorServer service is deserialized. Call the default deserialization of the object.

The engine does the job of retrying the inform requestswhen the timer expires and calls the SNMP adaptor server when a timeout occurs after exhaustingthe maximum number of tries.The inform request object provides the method, {@link #waitForCompletion waitForCompletion(long time)},which enables a user to operate in a synchronous mode with an inform request.This is done by blocking the user thread for the desired time interval.The user thread gets notified whenever a request reaches completion, independently of the status of the response.If an {@link com.sun.jmx.snmp.daemon.SnmpInformHandler inform callback} is provided when sending the inform request,the user operates in an asynchronous mode with the inform request. The user thread is not blockedand the specific inform callback implementation provided by the user is invoked when the inform response is received.<B>Note:</B><BR>From RFC 1905, the SNMP inform request is defined as a request generated and transmittedby an SNMPv2 entity acting in a manager role to another SNMPv2 entity also acting in a manager role.The mechanisms to implement this behaviour are defined in the SNMP manager API.Nevertheless, this feature has derived and in some documentations, the inform request appearslike an SNMPv2 trap that gets responded.<BR>The <CODE>SnmpInformRequest</CODE> class is used to fullfill this latter case.This object maintains a global counter for the inform request ID.This contains a list of <CODE>SnmpVarBind</CODE> objects for making the SNMP inform requests.The error status associated with the inform response packet.The index in <CODE>SnmpVarBindList</CODE> that caused the exception.private SnmpVarBind internalVarBind[] = null;private String reason = null;The SNMP adaptor associated with this inform request.The session object associated with this inform request.The user implementation of the callback interface for this request.The inform request PDU.private SnmpPduPacket requestPdu;The inform response PDU.private SnmpPduRequest responsePdu;Base status of an inform request.Status of an inform request: in progress.Status of an inform request: waiting to be sent.Status of an inform request: waiting for reply.Status of an inform request: reply received.Status of an inform request: request aborted.Status of an inform request: timeout.Status of an inform request: internal error occured.Status of an inform request: result available for the request.Status of an inform request: request never used.Number of tries performed for the current polling operation.Timeout. 3 seconds.

The ID is submitted to the poll server for scheduling.This method determines whether the inform request is to be retried. This is used if thepeer did not respond to a previous request. If the request exceedsthe maxTries limit, a timeout is signaled. Consider it as a try !Constructs an inform request PDU. This exception will caught hereafter and reported as an snmpReqUnknownError FIXME: may be it's not the best behaviour ?Sends the prepared PDU packet to the manager and updates the data structureto expect a response.

Create the trhead group specific for handling sub-requests associated to the current request. Use the invoke id Nice idea to use a thread group on a request basis. However the impact on performance is terrible ! theGroup= new ThreadGroup(thread.getThreadGroup(),                "request " + String.valueOf(req.requestId)); Good ! Let's make a full response pdu. First we need to split the request into subrequests Execute all the subrequests resulting from the split of the varbind list. It means that an error occurred. The error is already formatted by the executeSubRequest So far so good. So we need to concatenate all the answers.The method runs all the sub-requests associated to the currentinstance of SnmpRequestHandler. If it's a set request, we must first check any varBind Indicate to the sub request that a check must be invoked ... OK we should have defined out own tag for that ! No point to go any further. end processing check operation for a set PDU. Let's start the sub-requests.NPCTE fix for bugId 4492741, esc 0, 16-August 2001end of NPCTE fix for bugId 4492741 everything is okOptimize when there is only one sub request Check the error status. process the operationHere we make the response pdu for a bulk request. Split the request into subrequests. Now we remove useless trailing endOfMibView. respVarBindList[m2] item and next are going to be removed Trivial, of course...Check the type of the pdu: only the get/set/bulk requestare accepted.Check if the specified pdu is conform to the ACL.This method returns null if the pdu is ok. If not, it returnsthe response pdu to be replied. We check the pdu type and create an error response if the check failed. If the response is not null, this means the pdu is rejected. So let's update the statistics.Make a response pdu with the specified error status and index.NOTE: the response pdu share its varBindList with the request pdu. This should not occur because decodeIncomingRequest has normally been successfully called before. Reduction can be attempted only on bulk response We're going to reduce the varbind list. First determine which items should be removed. Next duplicate and replace the existing list by the reduced one. acceptedVbCount is the number of varbind which have been successfully encoded before reaching bufferSize:   * when it is >= 2, we split the varbindlist at this     position (-1 to be safe),   * when it is 1, we only put one (big?) item in the varbindlist   * when it is 0 (in fact, acceptedVbCount is not available),     we split the varbindlist by 2. acceptedCount == 0 ie it is unknownThe method takes the incoming requests and split it into subrequests. Take all the oids contained in the request and For the get next operation we are going to send the varbind list to all agents We need to create the sub request handler and update the hashtable Update the translation table within the subrequestThe method takes the incoming get bulk requests and split it intosubrequests. Send the getBulk to all agents Go through the list of subrequests and concatenate. Hopefully, by now all the sub-requests should be finished In v1 make sure there is no endOfMibView ...

If they, do there is nothing much we can do except to transform them into: <li> a global snmpRspGenErr (if the request is a GET/GETNEXT) </li> <li> a global snmpRspNoSuchName otherwise. </li>    If the request was a GET/GETNEXT then snmpRspGenErr is returned.    (snmpRspGenErr is the only global error that is expected to be     raised by a GET/GETNEXT request).    Otherwise the v2 code itself is returned v1 global error codes are transformed in the following way:      snmpRspNoSuchName               => snmpRspNoAccess  (snmpRspGenErr for GET/GETNEXT)      snmpRspReadOnly               => snmpRspNotWritable (snmpRspGenErr for GET/GETNEXT)      snmpRspBadValue               => snmpRspWrongValue  (snmpRspGenErr for GET/GETNEXT) Map v1 codes onto v2 codes For get / getNext / getBulk the only global error (PDU-level) possible is genErr.

Isn't it?If this is a class type thenIf T is a class type, then this must be the same class as T,or this must be a subclass of T;If T is an interface type, this must implement interface T.If this is an interface type, then:If T is a class type, then T must be Object (2.4.7).If T is an interface type, then T must be the same interfaceas this or a superinterface of this (2.13.2).If this is an array type, namely, the type SC[], that is, anarray of components of type SC, then:If T is an array type TC[], that is, an array of componentsof type TC, then one of the following must be true:TC and SC are the same primitive type (2.4.1).TC and SC are reference types (2.4.6), and type SC isassignable to TC by these runtime rules.If T is an interface type, T must be one of the interfaces implemented by arrays (2.15). TODO: Check if this is still valid or find a way to dynamically find out which interfaces arrays implement. However, as of the JVM specification edition 2, there are at least two different pages where assignment compatibility is defined and on one of them "interfaces implemented by arrays" is exchanged with "'Cloneable' or 'java.io.Serializable'" default.This commutative operation returns the first common superclass (narrowest ReferenceTypereferencing a class, not an interface).If one of the types is a superclass of the other, the former is returned.If "this" is Type.NULL, then t is returned.If t is Type.NULL, then "this" is returned.If "this" equals t ['this.equals(t)'] "this" is returned.If "this" or t is an ArrayType, then Type.OBJECT is returned;unless their dimensions match. Then an ArrayType of the samenumber of dimensions is returned, with its basic type being thefirst common super class of the basic types of "this" and t.If "this" or t is a ReferenceType referencing an interface, then Type.OBJECT is returned.If not all of the two classes' superclasses cannot be found, "null" is returned.See the JVM specification edition 2, "4.9.2 The Bytecode Verifier".on failure to find superclasses of thistype, or the type passed as a parameterTODO: Above sounds a little arbitrary. On the other hand, there isno object referenced by Type.NULL so we can also say all the objectsreferenced by Type.NULL were derived from java.lang.Object.However, the Java Language's "instanceof" operator proves us wrong:"null" is not referring to an instance of java.lang.Object :)This code is from a bug report by Konstantin Shagin <konst@cs.technion.ac.il> TODO: Is there a proof of OBJECT being the direct ancestor of every ArrayType? TODO: The above line is correct comparing to the vmspec2. But one could make class file verification a bit stronger here by using the notion of superinterfaces or even castability or assignment compatibility. this and t are ObjectTypes, see above. Waaahh...

sequences of instructions in an instruction list via regularexpressions. This can be used, e.g., in order to implement a peep holeoptimizer that looks for code patterns and replaces them with fasterequivalents.This class internally uses the java.util.regexpackage to search for regular expressions.A typical application would look like this:InstructionFinder f   = new InstructionFinder(il);String            pat = &quot;IfInstruction ICONST_0 GOTO ICONST_1 NOP (IFEQ|IFNE)&quot;;for (Iterator i = f.search(pat, constraint); i.hasNext(); ) {InstructionHandle[] match = (InstructionHandle[])i.next();il.delete(match[1], match[5]);$Id: InstructionFinder.java 1749603 2016-06-21 20:50:19Z ggregory $com.sun.org.apache.bcel.internal.generic.Instruction char + OFFSET is outside of LATIN-1 Potential number, some are not used instruction list as string map instruction list to arrayinstruction list to search for given patternsReread the instruction list, e.g., after you've altered the list upon amatch.

You can search forany valid opcode via its symbolic name, e.g. "istore". You can also use asuper class or an interface name to match a whole set of instructions, e.g."BranchInstruction" or "LoadInstruction". "istore" is also an alias for all"istore_x" instructions. Additional aliases are "if" for "ifxx", "if_icmp"for "if_icmpxx", "if_acmp" for "if_acmpxx".Consecutive instruction names must be separated by white space which willbe removed during the compilation of the pattern.For the rest the usual pattern matching rules for regular expressionsapply.Example pattern:search(&quot;BranchInstruction NOP ((IfInstruction|GOTO)+ ISTORE Instruction)*&quot;);If you alter the instruction list upon a match such that other matchingareas are affected, you should call reread() to update the finder and callsearch() again, because the matches are cached.the instruction pattern to search for, where case is ignoredwhere to start the search in the instruction listoptional CodeConstraint to check the found code pattern foruser-defined constraintsiterator of matches where e.nextElement() returns an array ofinstruction handles describing the matched area Where to start search from (index)Start search beginning from the start of the given instruction list.Start search beginning from `from'.Start search beginning from the start of the given instruction list.

The format pattern must be in the syntax specified bythe JDK 1.1 SimpleDateFormat class. The format pattern string isinterpreted as described for the JDK 1.1 SimpleDateFormat class.If the date/time format is right-truncated (i.e. in a format other thanxs:time, or xs:dateTime) then any missing components are assumed to be asfollows: if no month is specified, it is given a month of 01; if no dayis specified, it is given a day of 01; if no time is specified, it isgiven a time of 00:00:00.If the date/time format is left-truncated (i.e. xs:time, xs:gMonthDay,xs:gMonth or xs:gDay) and the format pattern has a token that uses acomponent that is missing from the date/time format used, then that tokenis replaced with an empty string ('') within the result.The author is Helg Bredow (helg.bredow@kalido.com) Get the timezone information if it was supplied and modify the dateTime so that SimpleDateFormat will understand it. Need to adjust it since SimpleDateFormat requires GMT+hh:mm but we have +hh:mm. Assume local time. Leave off the timezone since SimpleDateFormat will assume local time if time zone is not included. Try the time format first. We need to do this to prevent SimpleDateFormat from interpreting a time as a year. i.e we just need to check if it's a time before we check it's a year. Try the right truncated formats. Now try the left truncated ones. The Java format() function doesn't return the correct strings in this case. We strip any pattern symbols that shouldn't be output so that they are not defaulted to inappropriate values in the output.Strips occurrences of the given character from a date format pattern.list of symbols to strip.

The second argument givesthe padding string within which it is to be aligned.If the target string is shorter than the padding string then a range of charactersin the padding string are repaced with those in the target string. Which charactersare replaced depends on the value of the third argument, which gives the type ofalignment. It can be one of 'left', 'right' or 'center'. If no third argument isgiven or if it is not one of these values, then it defaults to left alignment.With left alignment, the range of characters replaced by the target string beginswith the first character in the padding string. With right alignment, the range ofcharacters replaced by the target string ends with the last character in the paddingstring. With center alignment, the range of characters replaced by the target stringis in the middle of the padding string, such that either the number of unreplacedcharacters on either side of the range is the same or there is one less on the leftthan there is on the right.If the target string is longer than the padding string, then it is truncated to bethe same length as the padding string and returned.The target stringThe padding stringThe type of alignmentThe string after alignment Default is leftSee aboveThe str:concat function takes a node set and returns the concatenation of thestring values of the nodes in that node set.

The second argument is a patternstring. The string given by the first argument is split at any occurrence ofthis pattern. For example:str:split('a, simple, list', ', ') gives the node set consisting of:<token>a</token><token>simple</token><token>list</token>If the second argument is omitted, the default is the string '&#x20;' (i.e. a space).The string to be splitThe patternA node set of split tokensThe str:tokenize function splits up a string and returns a node set of tokenThe first argument is the string to be tokenized. The second argument is astring consisting of a number of characters. Each character in this string istaken as a delimiting character. The string given by the first argument is splitat any occurrence of any of these characters. For example:str:tokenize('2001-06-03T11:40:23', '-T:') gives the node set consisting of:<token>2001</token><token>06</token><token>03</token><token>11</token><token>40</token><token>23</token>If the second argument is omitted, the default is the string '&#x9;&#xA;&#xD;&#x20;'(i.e. whitespace characters).If the second argument is an empty string, the function returns a set of tokenelements, each of which holds a single character.Note: This one is different from the tokenize extension function in the Xalannamespace.

In order to add a new message here,you need to first add a String constant. Andyou need to enter key , value pair as part of contentsArray. You also need to update MAX_CODE for error stringsand MAX_WARNING for warnings ( Needed for only informationpurpose )This file contains error and warning messages related to Xalan ErrorHandling.General notes to translators:1) Xalan (or more properly, Xalan-interpretive) and XSLTC are names ofXSLT is an acronym for "XML Stylesheet Language: Transformations".XSLTC is an acronym for XSLT Compiler.2) A stylesheet is a description of how to transform an input XML documentinto a resultant XML document (or HTML document or text).  Thestylesheet itself is described in the form of an XML document.3) A template is a component of a stylesheet that is used to match aparticular portion of an input document and specifies the form of thecorresponding portion of the output document.4) An element is a mark-up tag in an XML document; an attribute is amodifier on the tag.  For example, in <elem attr='val' attr2='val2'>"elem" is an element name, "attr" and "attr2" are attribute names withthe values "val" and "val2", respectively.5) A namespace declaration is a special attribute that is used to associatea prefix with a URI (the namespace).  The meanings of element names andattribute names that use that prefix are defined with respect to thatnamespace.6) "Translet" is an invented term that describes the class file thatresults from compiling an XML stylesheet into a Java class.7) XPath is a specification that describes a notation for identifyingnodes in a tree-structured representation of an XML document.  Aninstance of that notation is referred to as an XPath expression.Static variablesNow fill in the message text.Then fill in the message text for that message code in thearray. Use the new error code as the index into the array. Error messages...Get the lookup table for error messages.The message lookup table.Error message ID that has a null message, but takes in a single object.  add this message to fix bug 21478Earlier (JDK 1.4 XALAN 2.2-D11) at key code '204' the key name was ER_PRIORITY_NOT_PARSABLE In latest Xalan code base key name is  ER_VALUE_SHOULD_BE_NUMBER. This should also be taken carein locale specific files like XSLTErrorResources_de.java, XSLTErrorResources_fr.java etc.NOTE: Not only the key name but message has also been changed. Note to translators:  The following message should not normally be displayed   to users.  It describes a situation in which the processor has detected   an internal consistency problem in itself, and it provides this message   for the developer to help diagnose the problem.  The name   'ElemTemplateElement' is the name of a class, and should not be   translated.   for the developer to help diagnose the problem.  The substitution text   provides further information in order to diagnose the problem.  The name   'RedundentExprEliminator' is the name of a class, and should not be This code is shared with warning codes. SystemId Unknown Note to translators:  The following message is used if the value of an attribute in a stylesheet is invalid.  "QNAME" is the XML data-type of the attribute, and should not be translated.  The substitution text {1} is the attribute value and {0} is the attribute name.The following codes are shared with the warning codes... an attribute in a stylesheet is invalid.  "ENUM" is the XML data-type of the attribute value, {0} is the attribute name, and {2} is a list of valid an attribute in a stylesheet is invalid.  "NMTOKEN" is the XML data-type of the attribute, and should not be translated.  The substitution text {1} is an attribute in a stylesheet is invalid.  "NCNAME" is the XML data-type an attribute in a stylesheet is invalid.  "boolean" is the XSLT data-type an attribute in a stylesheet is invalid.  "number" is the XSLT data-type End of shared codes... Note to translators:  A "match pattern" is a special form of XPath expression that is used for matching patterns.  The substitution text is the name of a function.  The message indicates that when this function is referenced in a match pattern, its argument must be a string literal (or constant.) ER_ARG_LITERAL - new error message for bugzilla //5202 Note to translators:  The following message indicates that two definitions of a variable.  A "global variable" is a variable that is accessible everywher in the stylesheet. ER_DUPLICATE_GLOBAL_VAR - new error message for bugzilla #790 a variable were encountered. ER_DUPLICATE_VAR - new error message for bugzilla #790 Note to translators:  "xsl:template, "name" and "match" are XSLT keywords which must not be translated. ER_TEMPLATE_NAME_MATCH - new error message for bugzilla #789 Note to translators:  "exclude-result-prefixes" is an XSLT keyword which should not be translated.  The message indicates that a namespace prefix encountered as part of the value of the exclude-result-prefixes attribute was in error. ER_INVALID_PREFIX - new error message for bugzilla #788 Note to translators:  An "attribute set" is a set of attributes that can be added to an element in the output document as a group.  The message indicates that there was a reference to an attribute set named {0} that was never defined. ER_NO_ATTRIB_SET - new error message for bugzilla #782 Note to translators:  This message indicates that there was a reference to a function named {0} for which no function definition could be found. Note to translators:  This message indicates that the XSLT instruction that is named by the substitution text {0} must not contain other XSLT instructions (content) or a "select" attribute.  The word "select" is an XSLT keyword in this case and must not be translated. Note to translators:  This message indicates that the value argument of setParameter must be a valid Java Object. Warnings...Following are the new WARNING keys added in XALAN code base after Jdk 1.4 (Xalan 2.2-D11) Note to translators:  "name" and "xsl:processing-instruction" are keywords and must not be translated. and must not be translated.  "NCName" is an XML data-type and must not be translated. Note to translators:  This message is reported if the stylesheet that is being processed attempted to construct an XML document with an attribute in a place other than on an element.  The substitution text specifies the name of the attribute.Check: WHY THERE IS A GAP B/W NUMBERS in the XSLTErrorResources properties file? Other miscellaneous text used inside the code... Note to translators:  The following messages provide usage information for the Xalan Process command line.  "Process" is the name of a Java class, and should not be translated. Note to translators: The option name and the parameter name do not need to be translated. Only translate the messages in parentheses.
